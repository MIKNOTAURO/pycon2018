Compared to women who generally avoided fast food, women who indulged four or more times a week before they conceived took almost a month longer to become pregnant, the study of 5,598 first-time mothers in Australia, New Zealand and the UK found.   Overall, 2,204 women, or 39 percent, conceived within one month of when they began having sex with their partner without contraception and 468, or 8 percent, experienced infertility and failed to conceive after 12 months of trying.   While women who rarely or never ate fast food had an 8 percent risk of infertility, the risk was 16 percent among women who ate fast food at least four times weekly.   \u201cFast foods contain high amounts of saturated fat, sodium, and sometimes sugar,\u201d said lead study author Jessica Grieger of the Robinson Research Institute and the University of Adelaide in Australia.  \u201cAlthough these dietary components and their relationship to fertility has not been specifically studied in human pregnancies, higher amounts of saturated fatty acids were identified in oocytes (an egg cell in the ovary) of women undergoing assisted reproduction and studies in mice have demonstrated that a high fat diet had a toxic effect on the ovaries,\u201d Grieger said by email. \u201cWe believe that fast food may be one factor mediating infertility through altered ovarian function.\u201d  Roughly 1 in 10 women of childbearing age have difficulty getting pregnant. Most of the time, it\u2019s caused by problems with ovulation, often related to a hormone imbalance known as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Some signs that a woman is not ovulating normally include irregular or absent menstrual periods.  Less-common causes of infertility in women can include blocked fallopian tubes, structural problems with the uterus or uterine fibroids.  The risk increases with age, and can also be exacerbated by smoking, excessive drinking, stress, an unhealthy diet, too much exercise, being overweight or obese or having sexually transmitted infections.  Women in the current study were typically overweight and most of them ate fast food at least twice a week, the study team notes in Human Reproduction.   Researchers also looked at how often women ate fruit and found that those who had it less than once a month took half a month longer to become pregnant than women who ate at least three fruit servings a day.   With the lowest fruit intake, the risk of infertility was 12 percent, compared to 8 percent with the highest fruit consumption.   The study wasn\u2019t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how the amount of fruit or fast food women consume might impact their fertility. Another limitation is that researchers relied on dietary questionnaires women completed during prenatal visits that asked them to recall how they ate in the month before they conceived - a method that isn\u2019t always accurate.   \u201cA lot of maternal lifestyle factors are associated with infertility, like smoking, alcohol drinking or obesity,\u201d said Dr. Joachim Dudenhausen, a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.   The current study offers fresh evidence of the role diet can play in helping women conceive, Dudenhausen, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email.   \u201cThere are some studies showing that preconception intake of fruits and fish increase fertility,\u201d Dudenhausen said. \u201cThe study is in the same line and has clear data supporting the advice for women who wish to get pregnant to have greater intake of fruit and lower intake of fast food.\u201d  SOURCE: bit.ly\/2Ic3Y6R Human Reproduction, online May 4, 2018.

It does\nnot rely on ropes or stakes to hold itself up; rather, the walls,\nrafters, roof ring, and tensioning bands all work against each other,\nin a marvel of physics and engineering, to keep the structure\nstanding.  It is thus an especially appealing structure for camping\nevents where space is at a premium, such as Pennsic, because all of\nthe space it requires provides useful living space -- no extended\nropes are required as they are for pavillions. \n\nSCA campers have also\nfound other useful features that the Mongols must have designed into\nthe structure.  A yurt does not even think about moving or falling\ndown in a storm; consider, for example, the winds out on the steppes.\nWith a pavillion, the structure is provided by the roof canvas and\nropes; if any of these gives, the pavillion comes down.  With a yurt,\nthe wooden frame provides the structure and is much more stable.  The\nyurt frame also has a lot of redundancy built in; if a single rafter\nor piece of wall fails, the structure is not affected. \n\nBecause the\nrafters bear the weight of the roof ring, no center pole is necessary\nunless the yurt is very large.  The Mongols would build their cooking\nfires in the center of their yurts, opening a smoke hole for the\npurpose.  SCA campers faced with fire restrictions rarely have this\noption. \n\nYurts are also remarkably comfortable during the summer heat.\nOnce you get up in the morning, you can open the flap over the roof\nhole and hike up the walls in 3 or 4 places.  This sets up a nice\nconvection current, and the yurt stays relatively cool all day.  (Of\ncourse, this doesn't work when it's raining...)  There were\nafternoons at Pennsic XXIV when I was more comfortable sitting in the\nyurt than under a canvas fly, because the yurt had a vent at the top. \n\nFor modern (and historical) convenience, the yurt collapses down into\npieces no longer than 8 feet.  I transport mine on and in my Mazda 323\nhatchback, though I did have to install a roof rack for the purpose\n(much to the amusement of the auto dealer).  A minivan would also\nsuffice if you don't want to deal with roof racks. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThere are additional pieces, notably the canvas and the rope that\nholds the cloth walls up, but they are not structural. \n\nThis article describes how to build a yurt that is approximately 16\nfeet in diameter.  While in theory this can be scaled up, I do not\nknow for certain how big you can make a yurt without requiring a\ncenter support.  (I am told that an engineer determined that you could\ngo as large as 30 feet, but I'm not sure I believe that.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nNote that all of this lumber will weigh in the vicinity of 100-150\npounds.  If you transport it on a roof rack, make sure it's a real\nroof rack and not a `ski rack'; the latter will probably buckle\nunder the weight. \n\nI bought my canvas pre-made.  The canvas for my yurt comes in the\nfollowing pieces; there are many other ways to design the roof canvas,\nbut this is the simplest to implement: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nMy roof comes down to the ground in the corners and has to be staked\ndown there.  Some people have built roofs that are circular and\nconical, and these do not require staking.  Other people run a roughly\nfoot-wide band of cloth around the outside, at the top, over the wall,\nto hold the descending roof canvas down.  I'm not enough of a pattern\ndrafter to be able to tell you how to do a fitted roof, however.\n(Note, by the way, that my roof is not under any tension.) \n \n\nEach lathe needs to be drilled every foot, offset by\n3 inches.  That is, counting from one end, you have holes at 3', 15',\n27', 39', and so on.  (You should have 9 inches of lathe left after\nthe last hole.)  If you are cutting your own lathes and you have a\ndrill bit long enough to go through a 2x4 in the 4' direction, I\nstrongly recommend drilling the 2x4s before cutting them.  (A drill\npress helps a lot for this.)  Otherwise, you have to clamp the lathes\ntogether, hope nothing slips, and do a lot of extra work to drill the\nholes. \n\nOnce you have a pile of lathe boards, you start bolting them\ntogether into a lattice.  Make sure that all pieces going in one\ndirection are on top and all pieces in the other direction are on the\nbottom; you do not want any interlacing or weaving.  (This will\nprevent you from being able to fold the khana.) \n\nTo apply a bolt, push\nthe bolt through both pieces of lathe (with all the heads ending up on\nthe same side), put the washer and nut on the other side, use the\nwrench to pull the head as far in as it will go, and then loosen the\nnut by half a turn.  The last step is very important; you need to be\nable to move the lattices, but you also need to make sure the head of\nthe screw is firmly seated so it can't fall out.  (An advantage of\ncarriage screws is that they effectively have the washer built in on\nthe head side.)  And, of course, you don't want the nuts to be so\nloose that they fall off. \n\nYou can actually make the khana with 1-inch\nbolts instead of 1.25-inch ones if you want to; you have just enough\nroom to make everything fit.  One of the small benefits of a yurt,\nthough, is that you have 100+ convenient coat hooks; I used the longer\nbolts so I would be able to hang clothes, my cloak, hats, my drum,\ntowels, my drinking horn, and so on from them. \n\nThe ends of the khana\nthat adjoin the door need to be straight.  This means that the last\nfew pieces on each end will not be full-length; because you will have\nthis problem on both ends, you can cut down some lathes to make these\npieces with very little waste.  (See Figure 1.) \n \n\nFigure 1: One end of the khana. \n\nYou will need to break the khana into at least 2 sections for\ntransport.  To do this, pick a point approximately in the middle,\nremove the nuts and washers, and push the bolts out from the inside\nlayer of wood, leaving them embedded in the outside layer.  (When you\nassemble the yurt, you will probably want to fasten these joints\ntogether with wing nuts, which you can tighten with your bare hands.)\nSee Figure 2 for a diagram of how the wall comes apart into sections. \n \n\nFigure 2: Location of bolts to remove (to separate khana). \n\nBe careful when folding, unfolding, and carrying the khana.  Make sure\nyou lift it slightly off the ground before folding or unfolding.\nWhile the overall structure is very strong, each individual lathe is\nfairly weak.  (The good news, however, is that the weight is\ndistributed so well that you can even replace a broken lathe while the\nyurt is standing, and it's ok to have 3 or 4 broken lathes if they\naren't all next to each other.)  It's generally a good idea to keep a\nfew spare lathes on hand for repairs. \n\nMaking the khana is perhaps the most tedius part of constructing a\nyurt.  Don't be discouraged that it's taking a long time to insert all\nthe bolts.  You only have to do it once, for the most part. \n \n\nYou need 2 pieces of 2x4 that are 6 feet long and 2 that are 3 feet\nlong.  Cut tabs in the short pieces and notches in the long pieces, as\nshown in Figure 3.  When you put the pieces together, you'll get a\ndoor frame that's 6x3 (and 4 inches deep). \n \n\nFigure 3: Notches for door frame. \n\nMy door frame has leather hinges.  That is, there are sturdy pieces of\nleather nailed to the outside of the frame, with a `latch' at one\ncorner.  This allows me to unfold the frame while keeping it in one\n(long) piece; I can then fold this piece and toss it on the roof rack. \n\nYou might, instead, prefer a frame that you can take entirely apart.\nThe easiest way to do this is to drill holes through the 4 joints (in\nthe 4-inch direction) and put a bolt in each one.  This should also\nmake for a sturdier frame, as leather can loosen over time.  (You\ncould use metal hinges instead of leather to solve that problem, I\nsuppose.) \n\nThe important thing is that you end up with a sturdy frame.\nIt's going to be under tension from 3 directions, so you want to make\nsure it will hold. \n \n\nFigure 4 shows what a single rafter looks like.\n                                                           \n \n\nFigure 4: Rafter layout. \n\nFor ease of cutting, I recommend screwing 4-6 1x3s together and\ncutting them as a group.  You can then remove the screws.  This is\nmuch faster than cutting each rafter individually.  A jig saw works\nwell for cutting the rafters.  For the notch, you may find it easier\nto make the two parallel cuts and just use an old screwdriver to break\nout the pieces. \n\nThe holes shown in Figure 4 need to be large enough for a rope to pass\nthrough.  A 5\/16-inch drill bit would probably work, though it would\nbe snug; a 3\/8-inch bit should provide plenty of room.  You will note\nthat the positions of the holes are not shown precisely; the left one\nshould be within an inch or so of the notch and closer to the bottom\nedge; the right one should be 1-2 inches from the angled cut and\ncloser to the top edge.  Precision is not that important here -- but\nread through all of this article, including the setup instructions,\nbefore cutting the rafters so you understand the function of the\nholes. \n\nThe rounded outer edge of the rafter (at the khana end) should be\nsanded; your roof canvas will be pulled over this, and you don't want\nto cause wear on it.  If the top edge of the rafter has any rough\nspots or splinters, you should also sand them.  Other sanding may be\ncalled for depending on your tolerance for the occasional splinter.\nDo not sand the sides of the board at the end that will be inserted\ninto the roof ring; it is important not to change the thickness of the\nboard at that point. \n\nFor two of your rafters, instead of cutting the khana end as shown in\nFigure 4, use the cut shown in Figure 5.  These rafters will rest on\ntop of your door frame. \n \n\nFigure 5: The outer end for the door-frame rafters (make a 90-degree angle). \n\nSave the scraps from the rafters to make the roof ring. \n \n\nThe ring consists of two rings of plywood separated by pieces of 1x3.\nIt looks sort of like a large wooden doughnut, 30' across and 4' high. \n\nStart by drawing two 30-inch (diameter) circles on the plywood.  In\nthe center of each, draw a concentric 26-inch circle.  Cut these out.\nYou should now have two rings of plywood, each 4 inches from outside\nto inside edges. \n\nTake 3 pieces of scrap 1x3.  (Two should be 4 inches long; the third\ncan be longer as it's only a spacer.)  Take one of the plywood rings\nand position the 3 pieces of 1x3 together under it, such that the\ncenter piece (the spacer) points straight out.  (See Figure 6.)\nYou'll probably want to use some other 1x3 scraps to hold the ring up\nso it's level.  Check the 3 pieces to make sure they're right up\nagainst each other (no gaps), and when you are satisfied, apply 2\ndrywall screws to each of the outer pieces (see Figure 7).  Slide the\nspacer in and out a bit to make sure it can move.  You can now remove\nthe spacer. \n \n\nFigure 6: Positioning the 1x3 pieces and spacer. \n \n\nFigure 7: Positioning the screws. \n\nYou have just created a slot into which one rafter will fit snugly.\nNow do the same thing on the opposite side of the ring.  (That is,\ncreate another slot 180 degrees away from the first one -- not on the\nother side of the piece of plywood.) \n\nNow you have two starting points.  Pick one and place 2 more pieces\nplus the spacer as close as you can to the existing slot, while still\nallowing the spacer to point straight out from the center of the ring.\nScrew the pieces in, and then proceed to the next position.  As you\nadd slots, you will find that the inner ends are generally right up\nagainst each other, while there are gaps between the outer edges.\n(It's like the spokes of a wheel.)  This is normal; do not try to fill\nin those extra spaces between slots in the front.  All rafters must\npoint directly toward the center of the ring.  Figure 8 shows a roof\nring in progress. \n\nContinue to place slots around the ring until you run out of room.\nDepending on luck and skill, you should be able to place somewhere\nbetween 30 and 36 slots in the ring.  (You could get more in by filing\ndown the 1x3 pieces, as shown in Figure 9, but I do not think it's\nworth it.  30 rafters will be plenty.) \n \n\nFigure 8: Adding more slots (longer lines show where rafters go). \n \n\nFigure 9: Shaving edges to pack in a few more slots (optional!). \n\nOnce you have attached all the spacers to one of the plywood rings,\nturn the ring over (so the plywood is on the bottom), position the\nother ring on top, and screw it together. \n\nNote: you will find a drill\nwith a screwdriver bit very helpful in construction of the roof ring. \n\nOnce you have completed the ring, drill two holes in one side,\nopposite each other.  These are the holes for the center support (used\nduring erection).  See Figure 10. \n \n\nFigure 10: Positioning of support holes (ring viewed from bottom). \n\nMake sure the plywood on the side opposite from where you drilled the\nholes is smooth.  If the surface is rough, sand it to avoid wear on\nyour canvas.  You don't need to sand any of the other surfaces of the\nring, though you might want to sand the outside edges (plywood and\n1x3s) to make the ring easier to handle. \n\nYou might want to cover the inside edge of the ring in some way, to\nprevent rafters from trying to push through.  You can use scrap lathe\nfor this.  This is an optional step. \n\nAnother optional step depends on how you're going to be transporting\nthe ring.  You will note that when the yurt is set up, you will have a\nflat spot in the middle of the roof that's 2.5 feet across, and that\nis mostly not covered by wood.  Rain will tend to collect on the\ncanvas in the center of the ring.  So far I haven't had any problems\ndue to this, but you might want to find some way to create a `dome' in\nthe center of your ring.  One way to do this is to take some scrap\nlathe and form an `X' on the inside of the ring (see Figure 11).  This\nwill create a dome that prevents water from pooling. \n \n\nFigure 11: A domed roof ring (optional). \n \n\nDuring erection, the nails in the top of the support slide into the 2\nholes you drilled in the bottom of the roof ring, and one person\nstands in the middle of the yurt holding this up while other people\ninsert rafters (see Figure 12). \n \n\nFigure 12: The center support. \n \n\nPutting up a yurt works best if you have at least three people, though\ntwo can do most of it if they have to.  While at least one person I've\nheard of has built `support gear' to enable him to set his up all by\nhimself, I don't recommend this at first. \n\nHere are the basic steps to putting up a yurt: \n\n Find a good stretch of ground and spread out the khana.  (You'll\nneed about 50 feet.)  You want all the angles to be 90 degrees (so\neach section of criss-cross is a square and not elongated).  Overlap\nthe two sections and bolt them together as described in the section on\nconstruction.  While you're doing this, inspect your khana for cracks,\nand mark any pieces that might need to be replaced.  Hairline cracks\nthat haven't spread very far can be patched by wrapping duct tape\naround the lathe.  (This also serves as a visible marker so you'll\nknow which ones to replace later.)\n Stand the khana up in a straight line.  Be careful not to crack the\nbottoms of the lathes!  This is best done with three or four people\ntaking up positions along the length.  Go slowly.\n Walk the khana into a circular shape, leaving a gap of two or three\nfeet between the ends, with the ends of the bolts pointing into the\ncircle and the heads on the outside.  This is very much a process of\nsuccessive approximation; get it approximately round\/oval first and\nthen walk around it and fix specific areas.  Also make sure that your\nangles continue to be 90 degrees, and that the height is even.  (I\nwalk around the inside and spot-check the height of the top bolts\nagainst my own height.)\n Attach the door frame.  My door frame is tied to the khana (using\nmore rope than is probably necessary, but better safe than sorry);\nsome people bolt theirs.  See the discussion in the section on\nconstructing the door frame for more comments on this.  Whatever you\ndo, make sure the door frame is tightly attached.  A door represents\nan inherent weak spot in the design.\n Attach your belly bands.  Each band should be tied onto the door\nframe, walked around the outside of the yurt maintaining an even\nheight, and tied to the other side of the door frame.  Use a knot for\nwhich you can adjust the tension, as you're going to fuss with these a\nlot.  One belly band goes around the top (over the heads of the\ntop-most bolts), and the other goes halfway down the wall.  The belly\nbands keep the khana from spreading farther out.  See Figure 13.\n Verify that your khana is still maintaining an appropriate shape\nand height.  If you have to make any adjustments, tighten the bands\nagain.\n Now you're ready for the roof ring.  Take your center support and\nslide the nails into the holes in the bottom of the ring.  Stand the\nsupports up in the approximate center of the yurt.  (You'll have to\nguess.)  The person holding the center support needs to be able to\nkeep it vertical (so the ring remains horizontal) and needs to pay\nattention to what's going on because of the occasional falling rafter.\n While one person is holding the ring up, other people insert the\nfirst 4-6 rafters (see Figure 12), evenly spaced around the yurt.\n(Start with one, then the one opposite it, then the ones between them,\nand so on.)  The easiest way to insert a rafter is to stand outside\nthe yurt, lift the rafter over the top of the khana at an\nintersection, push the angled end of the rafter into one of the slots\nin the roof ring, and then set the end you're holding onto the khana\nand push the notch over the top intersection.  If you find that some\nrafters aren't quite fitting and some are trying to fall out, it means\nthe ring isn't quite centered and needs to be moved.  Be very careful\nwhen moving a `loaded' ring; falling rafters hurt!  (When I'm the one\nholding the ring, I try to keep my head directly under the center of\nthe ring, so I'll take any falling rafters on the shoulders instead of\nin the head.)\n After you've put several rafters in (about 8 in my experience, but\nit varies), the ring will lift up enough that the center support is no\nlonger needed.  At this point walk the support out and put the rest of\nthe rafters in.  You don't need all the rafters, but the more you put\nin the flatter your canvas will lie (reducing the number of places\nwhere rain can pool) and the more secure you'll feel.  At Pennsic XXIV\nwe used 30; we will probably go down to 24 or so next time.  I've seen\nyurts that used as few as 11, but I don't recommend that for a first\ntime.\n Now that there's real downward pressure trying to push the khana\nfarther out, you'll need to adjust the belly bands again.  11. After\nall the rafters are in, tie a rope to the top of the door frame on one\nside, run it through the holes in the ends of the rafters, and tie it\noff on the other side of the door frame.  (If your door curtain has\ngrommets in the top, you'll want to leave a few extra feet of rope at\nthis point so you'll be able to thread the curtain.)\n For extra security, run a rope through the holes in the rafters\nnext to the roof ring.  This prevents any rafter from moving more than\nan inch or two (depending on how close to the ring you got the holes).\nIt isn't necessary, but it's comforting.  (You'll need to stand on a\nchair to reach the ring.)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFigure 13: Positioning of belly bands on khans. \n\nThe structural parts are now done.  Now you just need to deal with the\ncanvas: \n\n Attach the wall by unfolding it around the outside of the yurt and\nattaching it with S-hooks to the rope that's running through the\nrafters.  If the grommets fall too close to the top intersection of\nthe khana in a few places, don't worry about it and just skip those\ngrommets.  If it happens a lot, adjust the position of the wall by a\nfew inches.  You should have enough wall left over to wrap around the\ndoor frame and into the yurt on each end.  Later you can use some\nscrap rope to tie off the center and bottom grommets on each end if\nyou like.  (Just attach them to a convenient section of khana.)  You\ncan attach the inside top corners to the rafter rope with S-hooks.\n Pull the roof canvas over the top.  (This is easier said than done,\nbecause the canvas is heavy.)  This works best with 3 people -- two on\nthe leading corners and one person inside the yurt with a pole (such\nas a spare rafter) to guide the center of the leading edge.  Go slowly\nand be careful of the center hole, which can easily catch on the ends\nof the rafters.\n Attach your door curtain.  If you have grommets in the top, take\nthe excess rope from the rafters, run the curtain through it, and tie\nthe rope off on the other side of the door frame.  If you have some\nother method of hanging your door curtain, use it.  You might want to\nget a couple of large S-hooks so you can hook the sides of the curtain\nto the khana during high winds, to keep the curtain from blowing\ninward and letting in rain.  I have a couple of roughly 5-inch\n(hand-forged) hooks that I use for this purpose; large hooks are easy\nto manipulate from the outside of the yurt.  Someone in Moritu has a\ndoor curtain that drags the grouns by a foot or so, and just keeps a\npiece of 2x4 on hand to hold it down.\n Take the smoke-hole cover, tie a 15-foot rope to each corner, and\ndrag it across the top of the yurt (this works best with two people,\none to pull each leading rope).  Check its position from the inside,\nand when it's centered, tie the ropes tightly to stakes.  To open the\nflap, loosen two of the ropes and drag the flap a few feet down one\nside.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCongratulations, you now have a yurt! \n \n \n\nThere are two ways to approach this, depending on how bad the tilt is,\nhow many rafters are already in, and how brave you're feeling.  You\nshould first try to push up on the lower side of the ring (with a\nspare rafter or the center support) and see if that causes it to\nsettle into a better position.  If that doesn't work, and you're\nfeeling brave, you can toss a rope up through the center of the ring\nand out on the high side, take both ends of the rope, and pull down\ngently.  (There's nothing quite so scary as standing under a loaded\nroof ring and pulling it toward you, but this does work.) \n \n \n \n \n\nOne obvious feature is that you have many, many places to hang things.\nIn addition to the pegs provided by the bolts, you can hang clothes\n(on hangers) by hooking the hanger over any intersection on the khana.\nYou no longer need a clothes rack.  (Alternatively, you could\nexperiment with a clothes rack that is anchored on one end at the\nkhana and at the other by a free-standing pole, so your rack is\nperpendicular to the wall.) \n\nThe yurt is large enough that you can curtain off a private section\nand still have plenty of room in which to entertain guests.  Because\nwe aren't allowed to have open flames (let alone campfires) inside\nstructures at Pennsic, I spread carpets over the floor.  (Pillows and\ncushions are an obvious addition, if you do a lot of entertaining.)\nIf you install a cross beam in your roof ring, you can hang a light\nfrom the center of the ceiling. \n\nS-hooks are your friends; they hook over the khana and can hold up all\nsorts of things. \n\nFor Pennsic XXV, I'm thinking of building shelves.\nThe basic idea is that a shelf will be approximately 1.4 feet long\n(the diagonal of one square on the knana), and the back corners will\nhave hooks that are spaced to go over 2 khana intersections.  In the\nfront corners will be cords or light chains with S-hooks on the ends.\nThese hooks are then attached to the khana directly above the\nintersections holding the shelf back.  (See Figure 14.)  I wouldn't\nrecommend putting anything heavy, like books, on such a shelf, but it\nseems like it could be a great way to store clothing that has to be\nfolded, jewelry, and miscellaneous small items.  I'm not sure if a\nshelf twice as long could be safely used, but I may try one. \n \n\nFigure 14: A khana-supported shelf. \n \n\nFirst layer: rafters, standing on their edges (so they're 3 inches high). \n\nSecond layer: khana, bolt heads down, one layer per khana section. \n\nThird layer: door frame and center support, to the sides of the khana;\ncarpets on top of the khana.  (The carpets help hold the khana down\nand protect it a little more.) \n\nThe canvas and roof ring go inside the car, as does the bag containing\nthe wing nuts, S-hooks, ropes, stakes, wrench, and miscellaneous items\nlike seam-sealer. \n\nRemember when tying stuff onto your roof rack to wrap and tie down the\nfront of the pile.  The khana is light enough that the wind produced\nby driving at even moderate speeds can otherwise cause it to bend up\nand break.  And if you don't know how to tie a diamond hitch, ask\nsomeone to show you.  It may seem paranoid, but it would be a real\npain to have to re-make the khana because it wiggled loose! \n \n\nJohan von Traubenburg provided tools, carpentry knowledge, the\ndifficult cuts,. and the realization that it was cheaper to cut our\nown lathes; he also helped with the first couple setups while we\nfigured out how to debug it.  Johan and Dani of the Seven Wells did a\nlarge amount of the construction work, which was especially nice\nbecause I prefer to remain far away from large power saws. \n\nI would also like to thank Haraldr Bassi, who bravely attempted to\nbuild a yurt from a previous, informal instantiation of my\ndescription, and got much farther than I would have thought possible\nwithout diagrams. \n\nI welcome feedback on this article, especially from people who\nactually build from it. \n \n \n ","time":1525927755,"title":"The Construction of a Yurt","type":"story","url":"http:\/\/www.pbm.com\/~lindahl\/articles\/yurt\/","label":7,"label_name":"random"},{"by":"clumsysmurf","descendants":10,"id":17035320,"kids":"[17035669, 17036340]","score":41,"text":"The Carbon Monitoring System assessed deforestation, such as burning rainforest to clear lands for grazing. \n  By Paul VoosenMay. 9, 2018 , 2:00 PM You can't manage what you don't measure. The adage is especially relevant for climate-warming greenhouse gases, which are crucial to manage\u2014and challenging to measure. In recent years, though, satellite and aircraft instruments have begun monitoring carbon dioxide and methane remotely, and NASA's Carbon Monitoring System (CMS), a $10-million-a-year research line, has helped stitch together observations of sources and sinks into high-resolution models of the planet's flows of carbon. Now, President Donald Trump's administration has quietly killed the CMS, Science has learned. The move jeopardizes plans to verify the national emission cuts agreed to in the Paris climate accords, says Kelly Sims Gallagher, director of Tufts University's Center for International Environment and Resource Policy in Medford, Massachusetts. \"If you cannot measure emissions reductions, you cannot be confident that countries are adhering to the agreement,\" she says. Canceling the CMS \"is a grave mistake,\" she adds. The White House has mounted a broad attack on climate science, repeatedly proposing cuts to NASA's earth science budget, including the CMS, and cancellations of climate missions such as the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3 (OCO-3). Although Congress fended off the budget and mission cuts, a spending deal signed in March made no mention of the CMS. That allowed the administration's move to take effect, says Steve Cole, a NASA spokesperson in Washington, D.C. Cole says existing grants will be allowed to finish up, but no new research will be supported. The agency declined to provide a reason for the cancellation beyond \"budget constraints and higher priorities within the science budget.\" But the CMS is an obvious target for the Trump administration because of its association with climate treaties and its work to help foreign nations understand their emissions, says Phil Duffy, president of the Woods Hole Research Center in Falmouth, Massachusetts. And, unlike the satellites that provide the data, the research line had no private contractor to lobby for it. Many of the 65 projects supported by the CMS since 2010 focused on understanding the carbon locked up in forests. For example, the U.S. Forest Service has long operated the premier land-based global assessment of forest carbon, but the labor-intensive inventories of soil and timber did not extend to the remote interior of Alaska. With CMS financing, NASA scientists worked with the Forest Service to develop an aircraft-based laser imager to tally up forest carbon stocks. \"They've now completed an inventory of forest carbon in Alaska at a fraction of the cost,\" says George Hurtt, a carbon cycle researcher at the University of Maryland in College Park, who leads the CMS science team. The program has also supported research to improve tropical forest carbon inventories. Many developing nations have been paid to prevent deforestation through mechanisms like the United Nations's REDD+ program, which is focused on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation . But the limited data and tools for monitoring tropical forest change often meant that claimed reductions were difficult to trust. Stephen Hagen, a senior scientist at Applied GeoSolutions in Newmarket, New Hampshire, was part of a team that with the Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space developed laser-mapping tools to automatically detect new roads and gaps in tropical forests, monitoring that helped the Indonesian government apply for REDD+ funding. The end of the CMS is disappointing and \"means we're going to be less capable of tracking changes in carbon,\" Hagen says. The CMS improved other carbon monitoring as well. It supported efforts by the city of Providence to combine multiple data sources into a picture of its greenhouse gas emissions, and identify ways to reduce them. It has tracked the dissolved carbon in the Mississippi River as it flows out into the ocean. And it has paid for researchers led by Daniel Jacob, an atmospheric chemist at Harvard University, to refine their satellite-based observations of methane. It's an ironic time to kill the program, Jacob says. NASA is planning several space-based carbon observatories, including the OCO-3, which is set to be mounted on the International Space Station later this year, and the Geostationary Carbon Cycle Observatory, due for launch early next decade. The CMS would help knit all these observations together. \"It would be a total shame to wind [it] down,\" Jacob says. This type of research is likely to continue, Duffy adds, but leadership will pass to Europe, which already operates one carbon-monitoring satellite, with more on the way. \"We really shoot ourselves in the foot if we let other people develop the technology,\" he says, given how important the techniques will be in managing low-carbon economies in the future. Hurtt, meanwhile, holds out hope that NASA will restore the program. After all, he says, the problem isn't going away. \"The topic of climate mitigation and carbon monitoring is maybe not the highest priority now in the United States,\" he says. \"But it is almost everywhere else.\" doi:10.1126\/science.aau1283 Paul Voosen is a staff writer who covers Earth and planetary science. \n  By Dennis NormileMay. 9, 2018 \n  By Dennis NormileMay. 9, 2018 \n  By Jeffrey MervisMay. 9, 2018 \n  By Matt WarrenMay. 8, 2018 \n  By Vanessa ZainzingerMay. 8, 2018 More ScienceInsider \nMay. 8, 2018\n \nMay. 8, 2018\n \nMay. 7, 2018\n \nMay. 3, 2018\n \nMay. 2, 2018\n More Sifter \n  Vol 360,\n\n      Issue 6388   Table of Contents\n \u00a9 2018\u00a0American Association for the Advancement of Science.

His real wife had recently died. Six months before that, their daughter, who was twenty-two, had left home after an argument and never returned. \u201cI thought I was a strong person,\u201d Nishida told me, when we met one night in February, at a restaurant near a train station in the suburbs. \u201cBut when you end up alone you feel very lonely.\u201d Tall and slightly stooped, Nishida was wearing a suit and a gray tie. He had a deep voice and a gentle, self-deprecating demeanor. Of course, he said, he still went to work every day, in the sales division of a manufacturing company, and he had friends with whom he could go out for drinks or play golf. But at night he was completely alone. He thought he would feel better over time. Instead, he felt worse. He tried going to hostess clubs. Talking to the ladies was fun, but at the end of the night you were alone again, feeling stupid for having spent so much money. Then he remembered a television program he had seen, about a company called Family Romance, one of a number of agencies in Japan that rent out replacement relatives. One client, an elderly woman, had spoken enthusiastically about going shopping with her rental grandchild. \u201cThe grandchild was just a rental, but the woman was still really happy,\u201d Nishida recalled. Nishida contacted Family Romance and placed an order for a wife and a daughter to join him for dinner. On the order form, he noted his daughter\u2019s age, and his wife\u2019s physique: five feet tall and a little plump. The cost was forty thousand yen, about three hundred and seventy dollars. The first meeting took place at a caf\u00e9. The rental daughter was more fashionable than Nishida\u2019s real daughter\u2014he used the English word \u201csharp\u201d\u2014but the wife immediately impressed him as \u201can ordinary, generic middle-aged woman.\u201d He added, \u201cUnlike, for example, Ms. Matsumoto\u201d\u2014he nodded toward my interpreter, Chie Matsumoto\u2014\u201cwho might look like a career woman.\u201d Chie, a journalist, teacher, and activist, who has spiky salt-and-pepper hair and wears plastic-framed glasses, laughed as she translated this qualification. The wife asked Nishida for details about how she and the daughter should act. Nishida demonstrated the characteristic toss of the head with which his late wife had rearranged her hair, and his daughter\u2019s playful way of poking him in the ribs. Then the women started acting. The rental wife called him Kazu, just as his real wife had, and tossed her head to shake back her hair. The rental daughter playfully poked him in the ribs. An observer would have taken them for a real family. Nishida booked a second meeting. This time, the wife and daughter came to his house. The wife cooked okonomiyaki, a kind of pancake that Nishida\u2019s late wife had made, while Nishida chatted with the daughter. Then they ate dinner together and watched television. More family dinners followed, usually at Nishida\u2019s house, though one time they went out for monjayaki, another variety of pancake beloved by the late Mrs. Nishida. It hadn\u2019t been a fancy meal, and Nishida wondered whether he should have taken the women, who were, after all, his guests, to a nicer place. Then again, in real life, the Nishidas hadn\u2019t gone to any of those nicer places. Before another meeting, it occurred to Nishida to send Family Romance a copy of his house key. When he came home from work that night, the lights were on, the house was warm, and a wife and daughter were there to say, \u201cWelcome home.\u201d \u201cThat was very nice,\u201d Nishida recalled, smiling slightly. He said he didn\u2019t miss the women when they left\u2014not with any sense of urgency or longing. But he did think, \u201cIt would be nice to spend some time like that with them again.\u201d Nishida said that, although he still calls them by the names of his wife and daughter, and the meetings still take the form of family dinners, the women have, to some extent, stopped acting and \u201cturned into their own selves.\u201d The rental wife sometimes \u201cbreaks out of the shell of the rental family\u201d enough to complain about her real husband, and Nishida gives her advice. With this loosening of the roles, he realized that he, too, had been acting, playing the part of \u201ca good husband and father,\u201d trying not to seem too miserable, telling his daughter how to hold her rice bowl. Now he felt lighter, able for the first time to talk about his real daughter, about how shocked he had been when she announced her decision to move in with a boyfriend he had never met, and how they had argued and broken off contact. On the subject of the real daughter, the rental daughter had a lot to say: as someone in her early twenties, she could tell that Nishida hadn\u2019t spoken correctly, or expressed himself in the right way. He\u2019d made it hard for his daughter to apologize and it was up to him to create an opening. \u201cYour daughter is waiting for you to call her,\u201d she told him. To me, this sentence had the eerie ring of something uttered at a s\u00e9ance. Nishida himself seemed uncertain about how and for whom the rental daughter had spoken. \u201cShe was acting as a rental daughter, but at the same time she was telling me how she felt as a real daughter,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet, if it was a real father-daughter relationship, maybe she wouldn\u2019t have spoken this honestly.\u201d Eventually, Nishida called his daughter\u2014something he says he wouldn\u2019t have done if the rental substitute hadn\u2019t helped him see her point of view. It took a few tries to get through, but they were eventually able to talk. One day, he came home from work to find fresh flowers for his wife on the family altar, and he understood that his daughter had been at the house while he was gone. \u201cI\u2019ve been telling her to come home,\u201d he said carefully, folding and refolding a hand towel that the waitress had brought him. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to meet her again soon.\u201d Y\u016bichi Ishii, the founder of Family Romance, told me that he and his \u201ccast\u201d actively strategize in order to engineer outcomes like Nishida\u2019s, in which the rental family makes itself redundant in the client\u2019s life. His goal, he said, is \u201cto bring about a society where no one needs our service.\u201d A handsome man in his mid-thirties, he came to one of our meetings straight from a TV interview, wearing a pin-striped suit and matching cufflinks and tie pin that featured a blue cameo with a horse. His business card has a cartoon of his face on it, and a slogan that translates as \u201cMore pleasure than the pleasure reality can provide.\u201d Born in Tokyo, Ishii grew up on the Chiba coast, where his father was a fruit dealer and his mother taught swimming. When he was in elementary school, his friends would gather around a pay phone to listen to him make prank calls, disguising his voice as a grownup\u2019s; only he could make such calls without laughing. At twenty, he was scouted by a talent agency, and got a few jobs as a model and a movie extra. He also had regular work as a caregiver for the elderly. He showed me pictures on his phone of his younger self at different senior-home festivities, dressed variously as Marilyn Manson or in drag, surrounded by delighted residents. He loved the feeling of helping people, and was proud of being the most requested caregiver, even when residents were transferred to different facilities. In effect, he was already a rental grandson. Eleven years ago, a friend of Ishii\u2019s, a single mother, told him that she was having trouble getting her daughter into a competitive kindergarten, because schools favored children whose parents were married. Ishii volunteered to impersonate the child\u2019s father at a school interview. The interview was not a success\u2014the daughter wasn\u2019t used to him and their interaction was stilted\u2014but it filled him with the desire to do better, and to \u201ccorrect injustice\u201d by helping other women in his friend\u2019s situation. Looking around to see whether anyone had thought to start a professional service of this kind, he came across the Web site of a rental-relative agency called Hagemashi-tai. Hagemashi-tai, which can be translated as \u201cI want to cheer you up,\u201d was started in 2006 by Ry\u016bichi Ichinokawa, a middle-aged former salaryman with a wife and two sons. Five years earlier, Ichinokawa had been deeply shaken by news of a stabbing at a private elementary school in a suburb of Osaka, in which eight children around his sons\u2019 age were killed. Such incidents are rare in Japan, and schools weren\u2019t equipped with appropriate counselling services, so Ichinokawa enrolled in a psychology course, hoping to become a school counsellor. Instead, he ended up launching a Web site that offered counselling by e-mail. From there, he branched out into renting relatives. A lot of problems, it seemed, were caused by some missing person, and often the simplest solution was to find a substitute. Ishii registered with Hagemashi-tai, but, at twenty-six, he was considered too young for husband and father roles, and his only jobs were as a wedding guest. Weddings are the bread and butter of the rental-relative business, perhaps because traditions that dictate the number of guests haven\u2019t changed to reflect increasing urbanization and migration, shrinking families, and decreased job security. Laid-off grooms rent replacements for co-workers and supervisors. People who changed schools a lot rent childhood friends. The newly affianced, reluctant to trouble one another with family problems, may rent substitutes for parents who are divorced, incarcerated, or mentally ill. One Hagemashi-tai client simply didn\u2019t want to tell his fianc\u00e9e that his parents were dead, so he rented replacements. In 2009, Ishii decided to start his own company. The first step was to think up a memorable name. He began researching phrases related to the idea of an imaginary family, and came across \u201cThe Family Romance of Neurotics,\u201d an essay by Freud, published in 1909, about children who believe that their parents are impostors, and that their real parents are nobles or royals. According to Freud, this fantasy is a child\u2019s way of coping with the inevitable, painful experience of disillusionment in his or her parents. If parents never stopped appearing as all-powerful, generous, and infallible, as they do to their small children, nobody would ever become independent; yet how can anyone bear the sudden, irretrievable loss of such beloved beings? The \u201cfamily romance\u201d allows the child to hold on to the ideal a bit longer, by reassigning it to \u201cnew and aristocratic parents\u201d\u2014whose wonderful characteristics, Freud wrote, are always \u201cderived entirely from real recollections of the actual and humble ones.\u201d In this sense, the child is not \u201cgetting rid of\u201d the parents but \u201cexalting\u201d them, and the whole project of replacing the parents with superior versions \u201cis only an expression of the child\u2019s longing for the happy, vanished days when his father seemed to him the noblest and strongest of men and his mother the dearest and loveliest of women.\u201d Ishii runs Family Romance alongside a talent agency and a tech consultancy, employing about twenty full-time staff members, seven or eight of whom work exclusively for Family Romance. He maintains a database of some twelve hundred freelance actors. Big one-time jobs, like weddings, account for about seventy per cent of Family Romance\u2019s revenue. The rest comes from personal relationships that may, as in Kazushige Nishida\u2019s case, continue for years. Ishii told me that, since 2009, he has played the husband to a hundred women. About sixty of those jobs were ongoing. At one point, early in his career, he was in ten families at the same time. It was not a sustainable workload. \u201cYou feel like you have someone\u2019s life on your shoulders,\u201d he said. He has since implemented a policy that no actor may play more than five roles at a time. One of the hazards of the job is client dependency. Ishii says that between thirty and forty per cent of the women in ongoing relationships with rental husbands eventually propose marriage. Male clients have less opportunity to become dependent, because rental wives, for safety reasons, rarely visit men at home; Nishida\u2019s wife and daughter made an exception because there were two of them. In general, rental partners and spouses aren\u2019t supposed to be alone with clients one on one, and physical contact beyond hand-holding is not allowed. The most difficult dependency situations involve single mothers. \u201cWe can\u2019t just push them away and say \u2018No, we can\u2019t do that\u2019 in a cold way, because we have a responsibility that we will play that role for a long time,\u201d Ishii said. In such cases, his first step is to reduce the frequency of meetings to once every three months. This approach works with some people, but others insist on more frequent meetings. Occasionally, relationships have to be terminated. In Tokyo this winter, I met with cast members from both Family Romance and Hagemashi-tai. They had attended weddings, spiritual seminars, job fairs, standup-comedy contests, and the album releases of teen idols. One woman had been impersonating a man\u2019s wife for seven years: the real wife had put on weight, so the husband hired the stand-in to go out with him and his friends. The same actress had also replaced overweight mothers at school events; the children of overweight parents may be subject to bullying. Ichinokawa and Ishii told me many more stories. A hostess in a cabaret club hired a client to request her. A blind woman rented a seeing friend to identify the good-looking men at a singles dance. A pregnant woman rented a mother to persuade her boyfriend to acknowledge their child, and a young man rented a father to conciliate the parents of his pregnant lover. Single women with marriage-obsessed parents often rent fake boyfriends or fianc\u00e9s. If the parents demand to see the boyfriend again, the woman will typically stall for a while, and then say things didn\u2019t work out. But sometimes the parents can\u2019t be put off and matters escalate. Ishii says that, two or three times a year, he stages entire fake weddings. The cost is around five million yen (around forty-seven thousand dollars). In some cases, the bride invites real co-workers, friends, and family members. In others, everyone is an actor except the bride and her parents. The rental best man gives a speech, often bringing the rental guests to tears. When Ishii plays the groom, he experiences complicated emotions. A fake wedding, he says, is just as much work to organize as a real one, and he and the client plan together for months. Invariably, Ishii says, \u201cI start to fall for her.\u201d When it comes to the kiss, some brides prefer to fake it\u2014they touch cheeks so it looks like they\u2019re kissing\u2014but others opt for the real thing. Ishii tries to pretend he\u2019s acting in a movie, but often, he says, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m really getting married to this woman.\u201d Of all the services offered by Family Romance, the most perplexing to me was \u201cRental Scolder.\u201d Scolders are hired not, as I had assumed, by clients wishing to berate third parties but by people who \u201cmade a mistake\u201d and need help to \u201catone.\u201d One actor, Taishi, a mild-mannered forty-two-year-old fitness instructor, told me about his first such role. The client, a company founder in his late fifties, complained of losing his \u201cforward-looking motivation.\u201d He had stopped joining his employees at meetings or for drinks. Instead, delegating his responsibilities to subordinates, he played golf and visited hostess clubs on the company tab. The company\u2019s accountant knew about these charges, so the employees probably knew, too, and this made him feel ashamed. Taishi, impressed by this level of self-knowledge and reluctant to shout at a company president fifteen years his senior, suggested that the client simply join the workers for a meeting or a drink, and stop charging personal expenses to the company. In response, the man launched into a diatribe about the correct distance between a president and the workers, explaining that any variation would intimidate the staff. He refused to go to even one meeting to see whether or not anyone was intimidated. As they talked in circles, Taishi found himself growing irritated. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, why did you send us this request if you aren\u2019t listening to me?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Only half-acting, he pounded on the table. \u201cThe problem is with your hard head,\u201d he declared, and threw the straw from his soft drink across the room. Rental apologies, the obverse of rental scoldings, can be particularly thorny. Ishii outlined some possible scenarios. If you make a mistake at work, and a disgruntled client or customer demands to see your supervisor, you can hire Ishii to impersonate the supervisor. Ishii, identifying himself as a department head, will then apologize. If the apology isn\u2019t accepted, a different actor can be sent to apologize as the division head. If the division head doesn\u2019t get results, Ishii dispatches a remorseful president. These situations can get complicated, because the real department heads and presidents aren\u2019t aware that they have apologized. Sometimes, if an offended party hasn\u2019t actually met the offender, Ishii stands in for the offender, who then pretends to be Ishii\u2019s supervisor. Ishii grovels and trembles on the floor while being yelled at, as the real culprit looks on. Ishii says that these scenes give one a surreal, dreamlike, unpleasant feeling. More stressful still are apologies involving affairs. A deceived husband sometimes demands a personal apology from his wife\u2019s lover. Unfaithful wives with unco\u00f6perative lovers may rent substitutes. Ishii\u2019s tactic, in these situations, is to apply a temporary tattoo to his neck and dress like a yakuza. He goes to the couple\u2019s house, and, when the husband opens the door, he falls to his knees and apologizes profusely. The idea seems to be to defuse potential violence through a combination of surprise, fear, and flattery. If the lover is married, the wronged husband may demand a meeting with both the lover and the lover\u2019s wife, hoping to see his rival\u2019s marriage destroyed. So lovers whose wives don\u2019t know about their affairs end up renting substitute wives. One actress I met described the lover\u2019s-wife roles as her worst assignments: in addition to making her feel guilty and terrible, they tended to run overtime, and the husbands shouted and behaved aggressively. Another rental agency offers a more specialized service: its name, Ikemeso Takky\u016bbin, means \u201chandsome men weeping delivery.\u201d Clients choose from a menu of handsome men corresponding to different types, including \u201clittle brother,\u201d \u201ctough guy,\u201d \u201cintellectual,\u201d \u201cswordsman,\u201d \u201cmixed race,\u201d and, puzzlingly, \u201cdentist.\u201d The teenage-looking \u201cdentist,\u201d dwarfed in his picture by a radically foreshortened toothbrush he was holding up to the camera, was, I later learned, a real dentist. Hiroki Terai, Ikemeso Takky\u016bbin\u2019s founder, told me that the weeping service is an offshoot of another business venture: \u201cdivorce ceremonies,\u201d which are intended to provide closure and relief from social stigma. In the past nine years, he has performed five hundred and thirty ceremonies. (For the four-hundredth ceremony, a husband, dressed as a human-size wedding bouquet, was attached to a bungee cord and pushed off a cliff by his soon-to-be ex-wife.) The ceremonies, which are often held in a dilapidated building, to \u201csymbolize a marriage that\u2019s falling apart,\u201d include a slide show illustrating, with bullet points, where the marriage went wrong. Fifteen couples have got back together after the slide show. On occasion, women who are embarrassed about their divorces have hired rental relatives to attend. Early on, Terai told me, he was struck by the large number of men who wept at divorce ceremonies\u2014\u201cThe women are usually O.K., but the men are bawling,\u201d he said\u2014and by how relieved they looked afterward. Realizing that he himself hadn\u2019t cried in about five years, Terai searched YouTube for tear-inducing videos, and found a Thai life-insurance commercial about a girl who didn\u2019t appreciate the love of her deaf-mute father. Terai cried, and felt that a burden had been lifted. He coined a phrase, rui-katsu\u2014\u201ccommunal crying\u201d\u2014and started a new business, leading weeping sessions at corporations, in order to boost team spirit. Today, there are some forty organizations holding rui-katsu workshops in Japan, most of them unaffiliated with Terai. In addition to ninety-minute corporate sessions, Terai makes a yearly trip to Iwaki, a city in Fukushima Prefecture, to run a rui-katsu session with earthquake survivors. Terai, now thirty-seven, says that attitudes toward men crying have changed since his childhood. As an experiment, he asked younger women what they would think of a man who cried. All of them said that they would think he was sensitive and kind\u2014provided that he was also good-looking. Having also heard from some female rui-katsu participants that the service would be improved if a handsome man wiped away their tears, Terai felt professionally obliged to start dispatching handsome men to help people cry. I had asked to try the service, and selected the \u201cswordsman,\u201d whom Terai took me to meet in a hotel lobby. (My translator, Chie, expressed surprise when I declined to book an eight-thousand-yen private room for my weeping session; I assured her that, though the swordsman was a novelty, it would be neither my first nor, in all likelihood, my last time crying in public.) The swordsman, a willowy youth with chiselled features and an expression of great sensitivity, wore a garment made by a designer specializing in modernistic reinterpretations of traditional Japanese dress. He began our session by reading me a children\u2019s book in which a little boy in Fukushima writes a letter to his grandmother and her dog, who have been washed away in the tsunami. \u201cAre you crying?\u201d Terai asked. \u201cYou have to cry, or he can\u2019t wipe away your tears.\u201d The swordsman, who is also a freelance model, looked solicitously into my face, holding a crisply ironed blue-and-white striped handkerchief. I explained that I had felt close to tears when the grandmother and the dog received the letter in Heaven and it made the dog\u2019s tail wag. \u201cThey all cry when the dog wags its tail,\u201d the swordsman said, nodding knowledgeably. Next, we all watched a YouTube video about a father who played the saxophone at his son\u2019s wedding. I waited in dread for the father to turn out to have cancer. Suddenly, the video was over. Nothing bad had happened. But when I looked up I saw a perfectly formed tear rolling toward the swordsman\u2019s jaw. Chie, too, was crying. Terai explained that, for him, the really tear-inducing moment was when it transpired that the groom\u2019s sisters had secretly prepared a piano accompaniment to the father\u2019s saxophone solo. All the same, Terai wanted to take pictures of the swordsman drying my tears. \u201cJust try to look sad,\u201d he said. I looked at the floor and the swordsman leaned toward me with the handkerchief. He told me about his audition for the weeping service, which had been recorded by a news program. To his mortification, he had been unable to cry for the camera: \u201cI had tears in the corner of my eye, but they didn\u2019t overflow.\u201d \u201cThe tear has to roll down the face,\u201d Terai said. But he had given the swordsman another chance. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t cry then, but I could imagine his crying face,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when I saw him cry I was exactly right.\u201d My next appointment, with Family Romance, was two hours with a rental mother, in the shopping district of Shibuya. I had been anxious about it even before I got to Japan. The day before my departure, my real mother wrote me a wonderful e-mail, wishing me a good trip and alluding, as I knew she would, to one of our favorite books, \u201cThe Makioka Sisters,\u201d a family novel written, in the nineteen-forties, by Junichiro Tanizaki. My mother had given me her copy when I was in middle school, and part of what I had loved about it was how similar the sisters\u2019 shared language and private jokes seemed to our own. Wasn\u2019t it because my mother had shared with me her love of Tanizaki and K\u014db\u014d Abe that I had become a writer, and was now able to visit many of the places we had read about together? It struck me as unfair that I was not only going to Japan without her but also plotting to rent a replacement. One afternoon in Tokyo, on a commuter train, Chie helped me fill out the order form. \u201cThere\u2019s a space here for your fond childhood memories,\u201d she said. I found myself telling her about the day when I was three or four and my mother, a young doctor, who worked long hours, came home early and took me out to buy a doll stroller. This unhoped-for happiness was somehow intensified by the unnecessariness, the surplus value, of the doll stroller. \u201cThe day we got the stroller,\u201d \u201cthe stroller day,\u201d became shorthand for\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. what? For a happy day, though I remember at a later date asking my mother why mentioning it always felt somehow sad. I was worried that she would tell me not to be morbid, not to find ways to be sad about things that were happy. Instead she said, without missing a beat, \u201cBecause why wasn\u2019t every day the stroller day?\u201d I met the rental mother in the caf\u00e9 of a department store. I hadn\u2019t seen her picture, so it took some time to identify the right person: a petite, middle-aged Japanese woman, her long hair dyed the color of honey. She stood as I approached. \u201cMom!\u201d I exclaimed, beaming. She returned my embrace, a shade distantly. \u201cSo how should we do this?\u201d she asked, speaking in unaccented American English. \u201cWould you like to interview me, or do you want to do the role-playing?\u201d Having booked her for two hours, I suggested that we might do both. \u201cThis is a little bit weird for me, because usually when I play a mother the daughter is in her twenties,\u201d she said, adding that she was fifty-six, which made her only sixteen years older than me. \u201cShould I pretend to be in my twenties?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo, I can act older,\u201d she said. As our backstory, she proposed that my mother \u201chad moved to Japan for some reason,\u201d and that we would be seeing each other for the first time in years. I agreed. All of a sudden, her expression softened. \u201cIt\u2019s been such a long time since we\u2019ve seen each other.\u201d Her voice, too, was softer, more wistful. I felt a mild jolt of emotion. \u201cIt\u2019s been really long,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much you remember. I don\u2019t know if you remember the times we spent together.\u201d The sorrow in her voice made me think of my real mother when she talked about the time after my parents\u2019 divorce, when I lived with my father. \u201cOf course I remember,\u201d I said encouragingly, and even found myself trying to retrieve an actual memory, before I remembered that there were no actual memories, because we had only just met. \u201cI mean\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. not in a very detailed way,\u201d I added. \u201cWell, I remember every minute we spent together, and I cherish every minute. I only wish there had been more of them,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have as much time to spend with you as I wanted, because of my work. That\u2019s something I regret now.\u201d I felt a wave of panic, as if a fortune-teller had told me something eerily accurate. \u201cYou had to work so hard,\u201d I said. \u201cBut what about your work? How do you cope with all the pressure?\u201d she asked\u2014and the spell was broken, because my real mother knows all about my work, and wouldn\u2019t have asked me that. I found myself telling the rental mother about the meditation app on my phone, and asking if she liked to meditate. \u201cI guess we\u2019re talking as ourselves now,\u201d she said, echoing my thought. I started to interview her. Her name was Airi and she had spent most of her childhood in the United States and Canada, because of her father\u2019s work as a research physicist. In the seventies, she did some TV acting, playing a \u201chappy Asian kid\u201d in the background of sitcoms. When she was fourteen, her father sent her to Japan, to \u201cgo into the system.\u201d Censured and ostracized for using English words, she learned to keep her mouth shut until she could speak perfect Japanese. After completing her education, she joined the corporate workforce, climbing to the upper levels of various international companies, before leaving her last position, two years ago. Airi registered with Family Romance shortly afterward, and now gets a couple of assignments every month. She doesn\u2019t have any children or close relatives; she lost her husband, her parents, and a hundred-and-ten-year-old grandmother in a span of twenty years. Sometimes the young women who rent her as a mother talk about \u201cthe b.s. they take at work.\u201d Listening to their stories, so familiar from her own life, she finds herself able not only to imagine but to momentarily experience how it might have been if she hadn\u2019t been too focussed on work to have children. Despite their different personalities and backgrounds, I heard certain resemblances between Airi\u2019s experiences and my mother\u2019s. My mother had also overcome many professional barriers to reach a high level in her field, in a country different from the one she grew up in. She, too, had left her work recently. As Airi described the things she liked about her life and the things that could have been better, I felt a strange sense of relief: she had faced some of the same challenges as my mother, and she didn\u2019t have a daughter; so it wasn\u2019t having a daughter that caused the challenges. We talked about the article I was interviewing her for. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just be a few lines,\u201d she said, and I suddenly started to feel guilty about my rental mother. I felt physical pain when she briefly alluded to her financial uncertainty and said that she couldn\u2019t \u201cgo on living like this forever,\u201d and when she proposed that I hire her as a translator and I had to tell her I already had one. The worst moment was when she mentioned that none of the daughters who\u2019d hired her had ever asked to see her again, and I realized I wouldn\u2019t be seeing her again, either. When she offered to show me around the department store even though our time was up, I found myself saying yes. Following the Meiji Restoration, in 1868, reformers united Japan under a \u201crestored\u201d emperor, and, after centuries of isolationism and feudal rule, set about turning the country into a modern bureaucratic military power. They drafted a new civil code, making provisions for what Westerners called \u201cthe family\u201d\u2014a concept that had no definite legal reality in Japan, and could not be expressed by any single Japanese word. A new word, kazoku, was coined, and a \u201cfamily system\u201d was drawn up, based on a long-standing form of domestic organization: the ie, or house. A product, in part, of Confucian principles, the ie was rigidly hierarchical. The head controlled all the property, and chose one member of the younger generation to succeed him\u2014usually the eldest son, though sometimes a son-in-law or even an adopted son. Continuity of the house was more important than blood kinship. The other members could either stay in the ie, marry into a new one (daughters), or start subsidiary branches (sons). Nationalist ideology of the Meiji era represented Japan as one big family, with the emperor as the head of the main house and every other household as a subsidiary branch. \u201cFamilism\u201d became central to the national identity, and was contrasted with the selfish individualism of the West. After the Second World War, a new constitution, drawn up during the Allied occupation, sought to supplant the ie with a Western-style, \u201cdemocratic\u201d nuclear family. Forced marriages were outlawed, spouses became legal equals, and property was distributed evenly among a couple\u2019s children, regardless of gender and birth order. With postwar economic growth and the rise of corporate culture, ie households became less common, while apartment-dwelling nuclear households\u2014consisting of a salaryman, a housewife, and their children\u2014proliferated. During the economic boom of the eighties, women increasingly worked outside the home. The birth rate went down, while the divorce rate and the number of single-person households went up. So did life expectancy, and the proportion of older people. That\u2019s when the first wave of rental families appeared. In 1989, Satsuki \u014ciwa, the president of a Tokyo company that specialized in corporate employee training, began to rent out children and grandchildren to neglected elders\u2014an idea she got from hearing corporate workers fret about being too busy to visit their parents. \u014ciwa\u2019s service was widely covered in the press; within a few years, she had dispatched relatives to more than a hundred clients. One couple hired a son to listen to the father\u2019s hard-luck stories. Their real son lived with them, but refused to listen to the stories. The couple\u2019s real grandson, moreover, was now past infancy, and the grandparents missed touching a baby\u2019s skin. The price of a three-hour visit from a rental son and daughter-in-law, in possession of both an infant child and a high tolerance for unhappy stories, was eleven hundred dollars. Other clients included a young couple who rented substitute grandparents for their child, and a bachelor who rented a wife and daughter in order to experience having the kind of nuclear family he\u2019d seen on TV. The idea of rental relatives took root in the public imagination. Postmodernism was in the air, and, in an age of cultural relativism, rental relativism fit right in. In 1993, Misa Yamamura, a famous writer of detective fiction, published \u201cMurder Incident of the Rental Family,\u201d a mystery in which an elderly cancer patient avenges herself on a negligent son by mortgaging the family house and hiring a more attentive rental son, daughter-in-law, and grandson. After she is murdered, two copies of her will are found\u2014one favoring the son, the other the rental relatives\u2014dramatizing the tension between received pieties about filial love and the economic relations that bind parents and children. Since then, rental relatives have inspired a substantial literary corpus. In Tokyo, I met with the critic Takayuki Tatsumi, who, in the nineties, wrote a survey of the genre. He explained that postmodern and queer novelists had used rental relatives to represent the \u201cvirtual family,\u201d an idea he traced back to the ie of the Meiji period, when adoption of family members was common and biological lineage was subordinated to the integrity of the household. \u201cAccording to Foucault, everything is constructed, not essentially determined,\u201d Tatsumi said. \u201cWhat matters is the function.\u201d I remembered a quote from Satsuki \u014ciwa that I had read in a newspaper article about her. \u201cWhat we provide is not familial affection,\u201d she said, \u201cbut human affection expressed through the form of the family.\u201d Replacement or rental relatives continue to feature in literature and film, and appeared in three recent Japanese movies I saw on airplanes. In one comedy, \u201cThe Stand-In Thief,\u201d an orphan with no relatives forms emotional bonds with a series of isolated strangers whom he meets while breaking into a house; in another, a stepfather pays his stepdaughter\u2019s deadbeat dad to spend time with her. The mood of these portrayals seemed to alternate between a kind of euphoria at the alchemy of the marketplace, which transforms strangers into loved ones, and a \u201cTruman Show\u201d-like paranoia that everyone you love is just playing a role. Both the euphoria and the dread may have their origin in the deregulation of the Japanese labor market in the nineties, and in the attendant erosion of the postwar salaryman life style. Thirty-eight per cent of the workforce is now made up of nonregular workers. (Much Japanese press coverage of rental relatives presents the work as a \u201cside job\u201d that newspaper readers can use to supplement their income.) In 2010, single-person households began to outnumber nuclear families. In Japan, as elsewhere, today\u2019s young people have more opportunities for mobility and individual self-expression, but less experience of security, community, and family. Meanwhile, the ranks of the elderly are growing. Tatsumi showed me part of a 2008 movie in which an older woman deliberately lets a young con man scam her, because he reminds her of her dead son. The movie is set partly in a cardboard village for elderly homeless people, which really existed in Tokyo. Like many aspects of Japanese society, rental relatives are often explained with reference to the binary of honne and tatemae, or genuine individual feelings and societal expectations. Authenticity and consistency aren\u2019t necessarily valued for their own sake, and the concealment of authentic honne behind conventional tatemae is often construed as an act of unselfishness and sociability, rather than of deception or hypocrisy. A case in point: the man who hired fake parents for his wedding because his real ones were dead eventually told his wife. It went fine. She said that she understood that his goal was not to deceive her but to avoid trouble at their wedding. She even thanked him for being so considerate. Still, although it goes without saying that many aspects of the Japanese rental-relative business must be specific to Japan, it is also the case that people throughout human history have been paying strangers to fill roles that their kinsfolk performed for free. Hired mourners existed in ancient Greece, Rome, and China, in the Judeo-Christian tradition, and in the early Islamic world; they were denounced by Solon, by St. Paul, and by St. John Chrysostom. They still exist in China, India, and, lately, England, where an Essex-based service, Rent A Mourner, has been operating since 2013. And what are babysitters, nurses, and cooks if not rental relatives, filling some of the roles traditionally performed by mothers, daughters, and wives? In fact, the idea that families are defined by \u201ca love that money can\u2019t buy\u201d is relatively recent. In preindustrial times, the basic economic unit was the family, and each new child meant another pair of hands. After industrialization, people started working outside the home for a fixed wage, and each new child meant another mouth to feed. The family became an unconditionally loving sanctuary in a market-governed world. In 1898, the utopian feminist Charlotte Perkins Gilman wrote of \u201cromantic love\u201d and \u201cmaternal sacrifice\u201d as ideological constructs: a bait and switch that kept women at home. Young girls were raised to value romance above all else and to cultivate their beauty to attract a husband\u2014then, by an unspoken contract, with no preparation or training, they were expected to turn into full-time, unpaid nurses, educators, and housecleaners, driven by a \u201cmysterious \u2018maternal instinct\u2019\u00a0\u201d that automatically kicked in when the time came. In late-nineteenth-century Japan, the state introduced a \u201cromantic-love ideology,\u201d which defined the \u201cideal sequence of a woman\u2019s life\u201d in similar terms: \u201cromantic love (courtship),\u201d followed by marriage, childbirth, the awakening of a \u201cnurturing maternal love,\u201d and the triumphant assumption of a desexualized \u201ccaretaking role.\u201d So writes the anthropologist Akiko Takeyama, in a recent book about Tokyo host clubs, where women pay a cover charge to drink and chat with personable, attentive men. Some housewives have spent tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars on their hosts, working extra jobs, economizing on groceries, or extorting their husbands. In this way, they experience \u201cromance\u201d for the first time since they became full-time caregivers and housekeepers, and their husbands started calling them \u201cmother.\u201d In a sense, the idea of a rental partner, parent, or child is perhaps less strange than the idea that childcare and housework should be seen as the manifestations of an unpurchasable romantic love. Patriarchal capitalism has arguably had a vested interest in promoting the latter idea as a human universal: as the Marxist psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich pointed out, with women providing free housework and caregiving, capitalists could pay men less. There were other iniquities, too. As Gilman observed, when caregiving becomes the exclusive, unpaid purview of wives and mothers, then people without families don\u2019t have access to it: \u201conly married people and their immediate relatives have any right to live in comfort and health.\u201d Her solution was that the unpaid work incumbent on every individual housewife\u2014nursery education, household-work management, food preparation, and so on\u2014should be distributed among paid specialists, of both genders. What often happens instead is that these tasks, rather than becoming respected, well-paid professions, are foisted piecemeal onto socioeconomically disadvantaged women, freeing their more privileged peers to pursue careers. When Y\u016bichi Ishii talks about \u201ccorrecting injustice,\u201d he seems to mean much the same thing as Charlotte Perkins Gilman. \u201cEvery human being needs a home,\u2014bachelor, husband, or widower, girl, wife, or widow,\u201d Gilman wrote. Thanks to Family Romance, someone like Kazushige Nishida, who loses his family, can rent a wife and a daughter, and, thereby, the comforts of home: varied pancakes, women\u2019s voices saying \u201cWelcome,\u201d the occasional filial poke in the ribs. Nine years ago, Reiko, a dental hygienist in her early thirties, contacted Family Romance to rent a part-time father for her ten-year-old daughter, Mana, who, like many children of single mothers in Japan, was experiencing bullying at school. Reiko was presented with four candidates and chose the one with the kindest voice. The rental father has been visiting regularly ever since. Mana, now nineteen, still hasn\u2019t been told that he isn\u2019t her real father. Chie and I met Reiko in a crowded tearoom near Tokyo Station. The meeting had been arranged by Ishii, who said he\u2019d be joining us later. Reiko, now forty, was wearing a simple navy sweater, a plaid scarf, and a marvellous aquamarine wool coat that looked like it was in softer focus than the rest of the room. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m telling my story,\u201d she said in a low voice, glancing around the room. She explained that she had married Mana\u2019s father, a man named Inaba, at the age of twenty-one, after discovering she was pregnant. He became abusive, and she divorced him shortly after giving birth. To Mana, Reiko said only that she and Mana\u2019s father had had a disagreement long ago, when she was a baby. Mana took this to mean that she was to blame for her father leaving, and nothing Reiko said could change her mind. At school, Mana was withdrawn, slow to make friends. By the age of ten, she avoided her classmates whenever possible, either spending all day in the school nurse\u2019s office or staying at home in her room, rarely emerging except when Reiko was at work. When Mana had been avoiding school for three months, Reiko called Family Romance. On the order form\u2014she had brought a copy of the seven-page computer printout to our meeting\u2014she had described the father she wanted for her little girl. No matter what Mana said or did, Reiko had written, he should react with kindness. When the new \u201cInaba\u201d first came to visit, Mana was in her room, as usual, and wouldn\u2019t open the door. Inaba finally opened the door a crack. He and Reiko could see Mana sitting on her bed, with the covers pulled over her head. After talking to her from the doorway, Inaba ventured inside, sat on the bed, stroked her arm, and apologized. Chie stopped when she got to that part of the translation, and I saw that her eyes were brimming with tears. After a moment, she got out the words that Inaba had spoken to Mana: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t come and meet you.\u201d Mana emerged from under the covers, but didn\u2019t make eye contact. Inaba, noticing a poster on the wall for the boy band Arashi, told her that he had once been an extra in an Arashi video. That\u2019s when Mana finally looked at him. \u201cHow much of what he says is true?\u201d Reiko remembered wondering, from the hallway. After what felt like hours, Inaba and Mana came downstairs, and they all had an \u201cincredibly awkward lunch.\u201d Reiko cleaned up in the kitchen, leaving Inaba and Mana together. They found the Arashi video on YouTube. Inaba really did seem to be in it, just for a second. At the end of the prearranged four hours, he stood up, and Mana, who had seemed almost cheerful, grew suspicious: \u201cOh, you\u2019re leaving\u2014so who are you?\u201d Reiko decided to hire Inaba on a regular basis\u2014about twice a month, for four- or eight-hour stints, at a cost of twenty or forty thousand yen. To afford it, Reiko spent less on food and started buying all her clothes at a flea market. One evening, after three or four months, she came home from work and asked Mana how her day was, and, for the first time in years, Mana answered, telling her what she had been watching on TV. I saw Reiko\u2019s face light up when she talked about the transformation that took place when Mana \u201cfinally learned that her father was worried about her,\u201d and \u201cshe became a normal, outgoing, happy kid.\u201d Reiko started booking Inaba months in advance, for birthdays, parent-teacher nights, even for day trips to Disneyland or nearby hot springs. To explain why they could never spend a night together, Reiko told Mana that Inaba had remarried and had a new family. When I asked Reiko if she planned to tell Mana the truth someday, her eyes filled with tears. \u201cNo, I can never tell her,\u201d she said, and then started to laugh. \u201cSometimes I wish Inaba-san would marry me,\u201d she said, through tears and laughter. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should say this, but I\u2019m also happy when he comes to see us. It\u2019s only a limited time, but I can be very, very happy. Honestly, he\u2019s a very nice man. Maybe you\u2019ll see.\u201d Reiko, it turned out, had been told that Inaba might join us at the tearoom. When we said that we thought the person who was coming was Ishii, she said that she didn\u2019t know anything about such a person. \u201cI think Inaba-san and Ishii-san might be the same person,\u201d Chie said. Reiko seemed skeptical: she didn\u2019t think Inaba was the president of Family Romance. For a while, we all just sat there, stirring our sweetened yuzu infusions. Then Ishii was walking toward our table, wearing a dark blazer over a black turtleneck. \u201cInaba-san!\u201d Reiko exclaimed. Ishii introduced himself, addressing Reiko politely, with the Japanese formal address. She reacted with playful outrage: usually, they spoke to each other as husband and wife. Now they sat side by side, across the table from me and Chie, not looking at each other. The understanding had been that after Ishii joined us I could interview them together, but they seemed to be operating on such different premises that, for a moment, it felt impossible to address even one sentence to them both. \u201cHave you wondered about Inaba-san\u2019s real name, and what he does in the rest of his life?\u201d I asked Reiko finally. She said that she hadn\u2019t, and she didn\u2019t wonder now; she felt like she already knew. \u201cI think he doesn\u2019t change,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s very natural. Now I see him like this and it\u2019s the same.\u201d Ishii smilingly protested, reminding her that today she was his client, not his wife. \u201cYou have something here,\u201d Reiko said, pointing to the corner of her mouth, and he reflexively turned toward a mirror and wiped his mouth. It was the first of several moments when he seemed to visibly toggle between Ishii and Inaba. Reiko and Ishii began reminiscing about their first lunch together with Mana. Reiko had prepared way too much food\u2014fried prawns, roast beef, corn soup, all things that Mana liked\u2014and Ishii recalled that he had decided to try to \u201ceat like a father,\u201d which, to him, meant \u201cwith no hesitation or concerns.\u201d To demonstrate, he leaned over the table, stuck out an elbow, and made a shovelling motion. The effect was patriarchal. Reiko laughed with delight. Her eyes met mine, and I beamed back at her. I wasn\u2019t faking\u2014it was a real smile. But what was I smiling at? I asked about the relationship between a real family and a rental one. Ishii replied that, although a rental family wasn\u2019t real, it could in some sense be \u201cmore than a family.\u201d This notion struck me as somewhat abstruse, but Reiko said she understood perfectly. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t gotten a divorce and was still married, I don\u2019t think that I would be laughing like this, or that I would be feeling this happy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily the case that the real family is the best thing that happens.\u201d Eventually, she got up to leave. As she put on her aquamarine coat, she said she felt very refreshed. Her face looked radiant, more mobile and alive than when we had met. Watching her go gave me a painful feeling. I could feel how much she loved him\u2014his square shoulders in the dark blazer. Ishii excused himself to go to the bathroom, and Chie and I wondered aloud why Ishii had chosen to reveal his true identity to Reiko in our presence. Maybe he had needed outsiders to give credence to what he was trying to tell her: that he was running a big, ambitious, significant business, that their relationship wasn\u2019t real, that they were never going to be married. When he returned to the table, I asked whether he had told Reiko that he thought they should stop Inaba\u2019s visits. He said that he had. Mana would soon be twenty. \u201cIf Mana got married and had kids, I would have grandchildren,\u201d he said. Grandchildren were wonderful, of course, but they would unavoidably represent more people in the world that one had to lie to\u2014not to mention Mana\u2019s husband and in-laws. \u201cBefore that point, I tell Reiko, she needs to tell her.\u201d \u201cDo you think Reiko will agree?\u201d I asked. Ishii hesitated, and said, \u201cReiko probably has a very strong feeling that she wants to continue.\u201d He said he honestly thought that Mana would understand if they told her the truth. I wondered if there was a way to make Mana see this as a story about a mother who adored her, and a sort of limited guy who, in his own limited way, had shown her kindness and stability. Sure, he charged fifty dollars an hour, but the world was full of people who were incapable of being kind and present no matter how much you paid them. Was kindness invalidated just because money changed hands? \u201cI\u2019ve been asked why I don\u2019t get married,\u201d Ishii said. Even though he\u2019s single, he has met scores of fianc\u00e9es\u2019 parents, kissed a dozen brides, apologized for cheating, even attended a childbirth. He\u2019s sat through private-school interviews and parent-teacher meetings, video-recorded sports festivals and graduations, spent days at Disneyland. If he ever becomes a father, how will his feelings toward his own children be different from what he felt on the job? \u201cI\u2019m worried now that I might just end up acting a good father,\u201d he said. Sometimes he has dreams about Mana, in which he tells her that he isn\u2019t her real father. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream, so she accepts it,\u201d he said. \u201cShe accepts the truth, but then she says, \u2018Even then, you\u2019re still my dad.\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u201cDo you believe that there\u2019s a sense in which you are her father?\u201d I asked. Ishii closed his eyes, looking tired. \u201cIt proves a possibility that\u2014even if we\u2019re not a real family, even if it\u2019s a rental family\u2014the way we interact with each other makes this a form of a family.\u201d One evening, back at my hotel, feeling jet-lagged and confused by all the stories I had been hearing, I decided to splurge on an in-room massage. Unlike the sessions with the weeping swordsman and the rental mother, a massage wouldn\u2019t count as a work expense. On the other hand, I reasoned, I had missed a shrink appointment back in New York, which cost more than the massage, so I was really saving money. Two hours later, a smiling young woman knocked on the door, waited to be asked inside, took off her shoes, and gave me a form to sign. The form said that I agreed not to demand a sexual massage, and that if I was a man I would keep the hotel-room door ajar. Everything contributed to the dreamlike atmosphere: her soft voice and sure touch, the fact that I was lying on the bed, and the compactness of Tokyo hotel rooms, which meant that she periodically had to move things around to make enough room to stand. At some point, I realized that she was kneeling next to me on the bed. How strange that it was somehow O.K. for us to be in bed like this together. \u201cYour shoulders are so hard!\u201d she said, somehow releasing the muscles with her fingers. I felt full of love and gratitude, and thought about how the fact that I was paying her, which could have felt uncomfortable, was instead a source of joy and relief, because it meant that I didn\u2019t have to think about anything at all. I could just relax. It felt like unconditional love\u2014the kind you don\u2019t get, or ask for, from people in your life, because they have needs, too, and you always have to take turns. I didn\u2019t have to give her a massage or listen to her problems, because I had given her money, with which she could do anything she wanted: pay bills, buy an aquamarine coat, or even hire someone to give her a massage or listen to her problems. This hour, during which she paid attention to me and I didn\u2019t pay attention to her, wasn\u2019t going to be entered in a ledger where she could accumulate resentment toward me over the years. I didn\u2019t have to feel guilty: that was what I was paying for. I\u2019d started off assuming that the rental schema somehow undercut the idea of unconditional love. Now I found myself wondering whether it was even possible to get unconditional love without paying. The questions I\u2019d been asking myself about what Ishii really felt for Reiko and her daughter made more sense when I thought about them in these terms. A person can do things professionally\u2014for a set time, in exchange for money and recognition\u2014that she can\u2019t do indefinitely for free. I knew that Ishii had put a lot of preparation into his job, watching family movies to learn how \u201ca kind father\u201d would walk, talk, and eat. Likewise, I had read about a host-club worker who studied romance novels in order to be able to anticipate and fulfill his clients\u2019 every need, and consequently had no time left for a personal life. \u201cWomen\u2019s ideal romance entails hard work,\u201d he said, \u201cand that is nearly impossible in the real world.\u201d He said he could never have worked so hard for a real girlfriend. I thought about my missed shrink appointment, and about a psychology professor I met, Kenji Kameguchi, who has been trying for the past thirty years to popularize family therapy in conflict-averse, stoical Japan, where psychotherapy is still stigmatized. He said that he thought rental relatives were, in an unschooled way, fulfilling some of the functions of group-therapy techniques such as psychodrama, in which patients act out and improvise one another\u2019s past situations or mental processes. Dramatic re\u00ebnactments can help people in a way that talking with them can\u2019t, because even when we are unable to tell someone what our problem is\u2014because it\u2019s too terrible to say, or because we don\u2019t have the right words, or because we don\u2019t know what it is\u2014we can still act it out with another person. In this light, transference, a key element of Freudian psychotherapy, may be viewed as a process by which the therapist becomes the patient\u2019s rental relative\u2014as Freud put it, \u201cthe reincarnation of some important figure out of his childhood or past.\u201d Thinking about transference, I found myself wondering who the masseuse was a substitute for. The swordsman who didn\u2019t succeed in making me cry? The psychotherapist whom I hadn\u2019t been able to see that week? The parents whose relationship to my childhood self I had presumably hired the therapist to replay? It was, I realized, with a falling sensation, turtles all the way down. My next thought was whether it was possible, in Tokyo, to rent a turtle. After the masseuse left, I looked it up. Two clicks later, I was reading about the Yokohama Subtropical Teahouse, where, for the price of a pot of tea, visitors may handle a variety of land turtles. The article was accompanied by a photograph of a leopard tortoise climbing on top of a larger, African spurred tortoise, which it seemed to have mistaken for the world.\u00a0\u2666 Elif Batuman has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 2010.

It can\u2019t evolve in to a modern language while keeping its backward compatibility. But it has given us a wonderful JVM ecosystem and lead to creation of many good languages Groovy, Scala, Clojure, Kotlin. Kotlin was born in 2011, But it gained popularity last year after google announced it as official language for Android. Kotlin has brought powerful features from many other JVM languages. Let take a quick glance at benefits of Kotlin for a Java developer. Every Java programmer hates Null Pointer Exceptions thrown at Runtime. Kotlin provides first class support to avoid null references at compile time. All objects are non-nullable by default and you have to use\u00a0? operator to define nullable types. Compiler will force you to use safe call operator\u00a0?. to access nullable objects. You can also use elvis operator\u00a0?: to assign default values. Kotlin automatically infers types, so you don\u2019t need to declare it explicitly. You can simply define variables using val for final variables and var for non-final variables. Note type can be inferred only if both declaration and assignment is done in single statement. In Kotlin you can use String templates for easier formatting of Strings. $is used to reference a variable and you can use ${} for complex expressions Kotlin provides data classes for objects used to simply hold values. It automatically generates equals\u00a0, hashCode\u00a0, toString\u00a0, copy\u00a0, getters and setters ( for properties defined as var) methods for data classes. You can also do object deconstruction of data class to extract properties to variables. Kotlin supports named method parameters so you don\u2019t need to create builders in most cases. Also, Kotlin supports default method parameters so you don\u2019t need to create redundant overloaded methods to pass default values. Kotlin provides concise way to initialize collections inline using listOf\u00a0, mapOf\u00a0, setOf methods. Maps also support intuitive syntax key to value for initialization. It also provides deconstruction of Map key, values for easy iteration. Kotlin supports object declaration to create Singletons in single line. In Kotlin, constructs like try and when are expressions that returns value. For e.g You can assign result of try to a variable instead of creating a local variable. Similarly for when can be used as expression. when is equivalent to switch in Java, but it is much more powerful. Kotlin provides is operator (equivalent to instanceOf in Java) to check if object is specific type\u00a0. Using is operator will automatically do casting for you. This will prevent Class Cast exception when you cast to wrong type. Kotlin provides with construct to easily call sequence of methods on same object without having to repeat the variable name. We generally use builder pattern and method chaining to that in Java. Kotlin makes it easy to do similar thing even for non-builder classes. Kotlin also provides apply extension function to achieve the same thing. To favor composition over inheritance, we often use delegation or decorator pattern, but we had to duplicate every method of delegated class in wrapper class. Kotlin provides first class support to simplify delegation using by operator. It will automatically implement necessary methods to call methods of delegated class. Of course, you can override specific methods when need to. Kotlin supports functions outside of classes, so you don\u2019t need to create a class just for static utility functions. Java supports lambda by automatically substituting it with anonymous inner classes, but you can\u2019t modify non-final variable inside lambdas. But in Kotlin you can also modify non-final variables within lambda. Kotlin provides very simple way to lazily initialize a property using lazy keyword. Kotlin interoperates with Java seamlessly, so you can easily integrate with legacy Java code. You can continue to leverage third party Java libraries and frameworks. Unlike Scala, Kotlin doesn\u2019t have it\u2019s own collection library, but extends JDK collections. So you don\u2019t need to write glue code to convert between Java and Kotlin collection types. Kotlin uses method name convention to overload many operators for readability. For e.g method plus is used to overload + operator, minus for - operator, times for * operator, div for \/ operator and so on. It supports overloading many more operators like %, +=\u00a0, +-\u00a0, ++,-- Kotlin provides concise way to define ranges using\u00a0.. operator. It also provides until keyword for excluding boundaries and step operator for skipping items. It has in operator to check for something in range. We can also overload\u00a0.. operator and in operator by implementing rangeTo and contains methods. Kotlin support easy way to add extension functions to existing classes. This is a very power feature that helps us to easily expand core language API. Kotlin is awesome but it\u2019s not yet perfect. It will take some time to evolve in to a great language. JetBrains and Google are actively behind Kotlin so you can sure be that it will only get better. If you are an Android developer, you should start using Kotlin immediately. If you are a Java developer, you might have to consider other factors like team members, company adoption etc. But even if you can\u2019t use it immediately, you should definitely learn this modern piece of beauty. Finally, As per thoughtworks technology radar\u00a0, companies can kotlin try in projects that can handle some risk.

I want to urge you not to adopt the standard. I, along with the vast majority of energy economist, believe that residential rooftop solar is a much more expensive way to move towards renewable energy than larger solar and wind installations. The savings calculated for the households are based on residential electricity rates that are far above the actual cost of providing incremental energy, so embody a large cross subsidy from other ratepayers. This would be a very expensive way to expand renewables and would not be a cost-effective practice that other states and countries could adopt to reduce their own greenhouse gas footprints. Because I, and most other economists studying California\u2019s energy policy, just became aware of this proposal, we have not had time to participate in the policy process or write public documents on the subject. At the least, I would urge you to delay adopting such a rule until independent analysis from energy experts can be made part of the record. I will add that I have no financial interest in any energy company. I am expr essing my views purely in the interestof moving forward with California\u2019s fight against climate change in a cost-effective way that can be exported to other states and countries. Sincerely, Severin Borenstein I agree and would add that allowing more building near transit and other hubs as with California\u2019s rejected SB827 would not only lower housing prices, rather than raise them as with this proposal, it would also be a much better way of reducing carbon emissions and saving energy. Good energy policy has always taken a backseat to sexy energy policy. If you think this has anything to do with energy policy, you're out of your mind. This is 60% about virtue signalling and 40% about kickbacks to companies with large Dem donations.     Actual energy production?    Affordable housing?    Who cares? Bingo. It's also fine 'deliberate hypocrisy' - the goal being to make the power base FEEL like they're \"doing the right thing\" while actually excluding people from CA, raising or maintaining status differences, and so forth. One wonders if the general demise of religion creates some kind of public psyche requirement for such nonsense? You are overthinking this. Its old fashioned banal corruption. A few energy guys, real estate guys looking to make a score from legislation. Rooftop solar is just a means to an end: piss off enough homeowners  who will demand that power companies implement more efficient and cheaper alternatives for renewables. You want incentives, then enrage enough homeowners that power companies cannot continue to make excuses. Right.    Cheap solar and wind energy is just lying around, pretty much everywhere, but power companies invent \"excuses\" not to use it. Next. Why would power companies NOT want to install utility-scale solar? In a regulated monopoly model the utility earns a fixed rate of return on prudently invested capital. In a dispatch-to-market environment (like California) generators want to be committed and dispatched at prices that will give them an adequate rate of return on their investment. If solar did that they would build it. One reason might be the relatively small - actually tiny - output of anything other than huge array facilities.  You tend to see stories about 20 MW facilities with the implication it\u2019s a lot of power.  Ivavpah is huge, and about 400 MW max.  Typical for a nuke plant is about 1000 MW.  You need a lot of 20 MW facilities to replace a nuke. I would speculate that the utility industry is also very conservative, in the sense of wanting to be really sure they can keep the lights on, and may be slow to decide to build the 50 neighborhood 20 MW plants to replace the 1 nuke plant. I would think there would be merchant power startups who might build half a dozen 20MW plants and sell the power. Somebody might ask why that\u2019s not an Alphabet business line. And it is so much worse than that.  A PV facility only produces peak power for maybe an hour or two a day.  Above 50% of power for perhaps a total of 4-5 hours a day.  For 16 hours a day it sits there producing nothing.    Another negative factor is that if an electric utility has a major PV system as part of it's power generation it must also have access to conventional electric generation facilities of the same capacity to be able to quickly take up the load if the solar out put drops or, as it does every night, the sun goes down.\nLarge commercial PV is a scam.  It is a big moneymaker to a few large offshore corporations who build them and run them and the rate payers pay about 4-8 times as much for that power then they would for a fossil fuel powered generation plant.  It is essentially a tax on all  users of electricity that was  forced on us by misleading propaganda. You can improve those output numbers some with one or two-axis gimbals, and the disruption to the system can be lessened by making the solar station curtailable. Not surprisingly, developers don't want their units to be curtailed so they push for 'must take' contracts in lobbying with legislatures and PUCs. Of course, that just pushes more of the cost of intermittency onto the rate payers. Big centralized installations might be more efficient, but would they be politically feasible? Aren't there tons of NIMBY issues involved? Can the government be trusted to handle everything to build those? Mandating residential solar roofs might not be the optimal solution or all that efficient (at least, not in the short term--in the longer term it might trigger a flood of new innovations and cost reductions) but it still seems like a positive step. NIMBY is not really an issue for building power plants, solar, wind or gas. Outside of urban areas (e.g. San Francisco) I have not heard of developers struggling to find suitable sites. Transmission, on the other hand, can be a real problem to get done, which is why most generation projects, including solar, wind up near existing transmission. Remember that idiotic fundraising campaign for solar roads? That was the jumping the shark moment for non-utility solar as far as I'm concerned. hey, rooftop solar at least works.  Solar Roadways did have an entertaining year, between their surface being broken by people stepping on it, catching fire from overheating, and then the creators being caught shoveling snow off it before posting pictures claiming to show that it had melted the snowfall That rooftop solar is a poor second to large scale (commercial or utility) solar has long been my position, including in these pages. Here is a PDF on school sized projects.  Those make much more sense to me.  They can be more rigorously designed, maintained, and monitored for ROI. Speaking as a Californian, I hope the State wises up.  If not, there will probably be messy positive byproducts of the plan, but a great deal of negatives, and general inefficiency. Get of California out while you can. Why? It just took over as worlds 5th largest economy from the UK. Theres money to be made. A lot of it. There's a lot of ruin in a country - or even a state. California been berry berry good to me. Felicitations! Yep.  I've also pointed this out a number of times over the past few years. Its interesting to note that even new construction of big box stores and strip centers does not routinely include solar panels, which I view as fairly good empirical evidence that its not economical. Yet its got to be more economical to install 100 or 200 panels on a roof than 12 on a residence. \"NREL Report Shows Utility-Scale Solar PV System Cost Fell Nearly 30% Last Year\" (in 2016 that is). That should make a big difference in forward projects.  Sure, even 2013 projects where in a wholly different cost environment. Tax carbon emissions from power plants at some rate that offsets the reduced standard of living for future generations due to climate change, and roof top solar becomes very economical. LOL. Let me know what sort of living standards you get with rooftop solar and giant windmills everywhere. Are there any solar panel factories with rooftop solar panels? Solar-powered intermodal carrying all the solar panels from China? 'Let me know what sort of living standards you get with rooftop solar and giant windmills everywhere.' Yep, Germany is a socialist hell hole, no question. If Germany had to make up that other 80% of its energy from non-renewables you wouldn't even be on the Internet. You'd be too busy chopping wood for your stove to cook your yummy potatoes and cabbage. 67% in 2017, actually, compared to 71% in 2016, when talking about electricity - 'Der Anteil erneuerbarer Energien an der Stromerzeugung hat in diesem Jahr 33 Prozent erreicht gegen\u00fcber 29 Prozent im Vorjahr.

Sure, there will come a point where the constant growth of renewable electricity in Germany will top out, but till now, everyone who said it would be impossible to have a modern reliable electrical grid using 10%, or 15%, or 20%, or 25%, or 30% renewable electricity has turned out to be wrong. You've got 20%, not 25 or 30%. Again, all renewables and you will have people freezing to death in apartments. After they've chopped down the Black Forest to build fires. since I power everything off a solar\/battery set up. You absolutely do not, unless you live in a Kazcinsky-style strugglehut. Or maybe you do. Tax carbon emissions from power plants at some rate that offsets the reduced standard of living for future generations due to climate change, and roof top solar becomes very economical. I do not think so, rather I would bet that if you taxed co2 and paid out the money for semi permanently removing co2 from the air enough to reach equilibrium, solar would still not yet be economical. \"Rooftop Solar is Expensive and Inefficient\"\nYet, my tan tells another story. I had to pick myself up off the floor after reading the final line in this post about building near transit hubs lowering housing prices.  The experience with the DC Metro system clearly points to a contrary outcome.  In my area of Bethesda, every new high rise going up has way above market rents or sales prices in the case of condos. Those moving into the buildings will leave behind now newly more affordable housing.  Supply and demand does work. Building more housing anywhere is what increases supply and lowers housing prices.  But don't expect the brand new housing to be the most affordable.  The affordable housing generally will be the older stock, whose price is lowered by the overall increase in supply. The reason to favor SB827 wasn't because it was going to result in a lot of affordable housing near transit lines, but because the 'lift housing restrictions near transit lines' rationale was the only one that any had hope of cutting through the regulatory thicket of CA building restrictions. Strangely, solar hot water heating is very efficient, and yet somehow does not get much play in the land of large electric water heaters. \"...in the land of large electric water heaters\" Actually, the U.S. is more a land of large, natural gas water heaters. Certainly not where I grew up. Admittedly, I was thinking residential and suburban, not commercial or urban (I believe that many buildings in NYC use oil for water heating, even today). And propane is certainly common in more isolated rural areas. So let me check - and not much luck, though the Energy Dept. does say that 17% of a home's energy use is heating water - and that is the largest single energy consumer. But then EIA says something considerably different, at least in terms of ranking. To be honest, this looks like pretty much that even a regional generalization may not be possible. I will say that absolutely none of the places I have lived in or known in NoVa ever used natural gas for water heating. The only exception was a house with its own propane tank way out on Rt 15, but I'm pretty sure that is not what you meant by natural gas. Just over half of all homes (53 percent) are served by gas water heaters; most\nof the rest are served by electric (40 percent). Other energy sources for water\nheating include fuel oil (used primarily in the Northeast), propane, wood,\nand solar https:\/\/www.energystar.gov\/ia\/partners\/prod_development\/new_specs\/downloads\/water_heaters\/Water_Heater_Market_Profile_Sept2009.pdf Given how far natural gas prices have fallen due to fracking since 2009, I'd expect the numbers using natural gas to gone up further. Makes sense, though not in NoVa - basically, it seems as if the costs of bringing natural gas to the already developed areas of NoVa cannot compete with Dominion being involved in pipelines to bring gas to gigawatt range electrical generating stations.  I think this is extremely regional, even in a place like Virginia, and the fall in the price of natural gas may not play a major role in many places. A pipeline network with a residential component is considerably more expensive than a point to point pipeline feeding a major generating station - and upgrading an existing network is likely much more expensive.  Interesting subject, though of course the savings for the homeowner are unchanged. The Virginia pipeline link - http:\/\/www.virginiaplaces.org\/transportation\/gaspipelineexpansion.html Virginia pipeline Is she related to Florida Pipeline?  Maybe you don't know the joke. I think I've had gas in every place I've lived in NoVa (almost 20 years), including Alexandria and Fairfax. Having priced it out recently, I can assert that the fixed costs for retrofitting indirect solar water heat onto existing construction overwhelm any expected fuel savings. Progger act like religious zealots. They don't care about facts. Severin Borenstein, Please work with the large utility companies to stop charging over $.35 for usage during peak hours.  For an owner of a single home, Solar saves me $30\/month from the prices SCE charge.  Remember on a consumer individual basis we are not just paying energy production. Yes, I agree solar should not be mandated. Why would he do that? Why would they stop doing that? Peak electricity is expensive. 35-40c\/kWh is just a bonkers price to pay.  It's going to kick off a death spiral for the utilities, driven by their addiction to monopoly profits.  The powerwalls are coming for them.  For 16k$ I could cut the cord entirely, I'm just waiting for some superextractive time of use tariff to make it pencil out. SCE is providing you with a very different product than the product you are selling back to them. They must stand ready to provide you with power whenever you demand it, but you are only providing them with power when you've got it. So if you are net metered at the retail rate, you are being subsidized by the rest of the SCE customer base. Why only new construction?\nWhy not mandate that rooftop solar be added any time ownership changes hands?  (Suggesting a way to poison pill the thing, here.) Of course it is. If it was inexpensive and efficient they wouldn't need to mandate it. The professor suggests that rooftop solar is only valuable because residential energy prices are higher than marginal generating costs \u2014 but if you were to spend the same money on industrial solar generation you'd get much better value. Then, isn't part of the benefit here that these homes will avoid some of the inefficiencies of the power grid? It sounds like putting power generation directly on top of the consumers has an efficiency advantage over industrial generation. Perhaps that would be true whether it were a solar roof or a teeny tiny coal plant inside your fireplace (of course the coal plant would be environmentally harmful). If it's worth it, why not do it? Transmission line loss is very small compared to the scale economies that the professor is talking about. There could be benefits from delay of infrastructure investment in distribution areas that are near max capacity, but that benefit could be more than completely off-set by the additional wear-and-tear on substation hardware from increased net load variability that comes with roof-top solar. The people I speak to tell me that there is no distribution benefit discernable from residential solar. Thanks. Then the question is why rooftop solar will reduce my personal electricity costs rather than purchasing everything from the grid. Is it a matter of pricing incentives? That is, the utility will charge you per watt-hour, even though there are significant capital costs to them that don't depend on my total usage. Would rooftop solar become relatively uneconomical if the cost of being connected to the grid were separated from the marginal cost of power from the grid? \"It sounds like putting power generation directly on top of the consumers has an efficiency advantage over industrial generation.\" Electrical line loss is, typically, very small. Usually, under 1%. per http:\/\/insideenergy.org\/2015\/11\/06\/lost-in-transmission-how-much-electricity-disappears-between-a-power-plant-and-your-plug\/ California seems to lose about 10%.  Maybe it's 1% on a specific high voltage line, but after you step it up and down a few times it seems like it comes out to more then 1%. \"It sounds like putting power generation directly on top of the consumers has an efficiency advantage over industrial generation.\" Yes, the efficiency is that as our energy needs grow, the utility grid doesn't expand automatically and easily. Adding new power plants is expensive, difficult, and not assured.\nWhereas adding power generation on every single house is simple and easily done. It doesn't work that way, however. The utility has to size the distribution network for the amount of power the customers are going to want when they want it, not the amount that they are going to want when the sun is shining. Not many customers will be happy if their AC goes out on a hot, humid, overcast day because the utility didn't build enough capacity to handle the load when rooftop solar wasn't producing. In addition, intermittency puts stress on hardware at the substation level and below, decreasing the effective lifetimes of expensive components of the system. And the distribution network does expand pretty quickly and regularly. Expanding substations can result in some neighborhood squabbles, but they are usually pretty easily mediated. New distribution in new subdivisions is a snap. The impact of rooftop solar vs. utility-scale solar on transmission is generally very negligible, from what I've seen. I've never met a distribution or transmission person who thought that distributed solar provided any measureable advantage to the network. It's all about generation and related ancillary services, and building new power plants is much cheaper, all-in, than solar, either roof-top or utility-scale. \"Hot, humid, and overcast\" doesn't describe California. I will add that I have no financial interest in any energy company. wonder what his investments look like. A cynical person might suggest that consulting or speaking fees, for example, are not a financial interest in any energy company, even when those fees are ever so coincidentally paid by those involved in the energy industry. It's remarkable that climate policy seems utterly indifferent to developments in climate science. After the IPCC downgraded its estimate of temperature sensitivity to CO2 in its latest reports, dozens of new studies are increasingly suggesting that this sensitivity is much lower than initial estimates. The recent study by Judith Curry and Nic Lewis suggests the sensitivity of standard models is up to 50% too high. https:\/\/judithcurry.com\/2018\/04\/24\/impact-of-recent-forcing-and-ocean-heat-uptake-data-on-estimates-of-climate-sensitivity\/ Has any politician or government reassessed their policies based on the latest science? Of course not.  Incidentally, when I Googled \"Lewis Curry climate sensitivity\", the first search result for this widely discussed study wasn't the study itself or one of the very popular skeptic sites, but a site called And Then There's Physics known in the skeptic community for its rabid promotion of AGW.  Curry's own site is ranked about 150,000 in the US while ATTP is at 1 million, but Google pointed me to a small and obscure critic rather than the study. Google has its thumb on the scale. I have rooftop solar but no battery storage on-site, so I am probably not reducing my utility company's base load very much (though I can run my A\/C on full blast in the heat of the day without affecting peak load...) But what I've wondered is why don't utility companies invest in large scale battery farms that \"soak up\" the excess solar on the grid and allow them to use it overnight and lower their production at those more predictable hours...? Is the scale of such a battery farm so large that even with a warehouse full of them you could only power a city for 30 minutes? Not sure where that technology is at. \"But what I've wondered is why don't utility companies invest in large scale battery farms that \"soak up\" the excess solar on the grid and allow them to use it overnight and lower their production at those more predictable hours...?\" I believe the battery cost amortized over the expected number of charge\/discharge cycles exceeds the cost of power from a peaking plant by a large margin, thus utilities will only talk about battery backup if the taxpayer is on the hook for the costs. https:\/\/www.powertechsystems.eu\/home\/tech-corner\/lithium-ion-vs-lead-acid-cost-analysis\/ https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Peaking_power_plant Depend on how large the warehouse and the small the city, but in general (and real life) I think you will find that any realistic size battery bank is very small when compared to city sized needs.  I\u2019d be surprised if as much as 30 minutes was achievable. Battery technology lags behind, although there are some promising developments in redox flow batteries where energy is stored in liquid form and the capacity can be scaled using tanks and pumps. I find Borenstein's argument in favor of centralized solar unconvincing. All the studies I've seen this far show they are less efficient for the homeowner when you factor transmission losses and the utility's margin. In Hawai'i at least the case for rooftop solar is overwhelming, and California's weather is not much less sunny. The biggest cost in rooftop solar is installation, it's quite plausible that requiring it from the get-go would reduce them because the labor costs of laying a roof like Tesla's may not be that much higher than a conventional one. I've never seen a study that showed that rooftop competes with utility-scale solar. Not that you couldn't construct one. Say I put the utility solar in Minnesota, pointed it north and wheeled the power to San Antonio. The benefits of utility-scale solar relative to roof-top include multi-axis targeting and curtailability. Those are pretty big benefits. As for Hawaii, I doubt that the economic case for rooftop is really that good compared to utility-scale solar given that the line losses should be trivial, much less reasonable thermal alternatives (e.g. LNG). Battery technology is a long way from being able to provide an economic arbitrage tool. Deep cycling electro-chemical batteries kills their useful life so you can be looking at replacing fleets of batteries (each the size of a railroad car) in a time-scale measured in months. Most of the action in utility-scale battery use is in delaying distribution investment, regulation service, maybe voltage control...things like that, but not shifting generation over hours. Now, if you've got the topography for pumped storage you can arb power, but you generally face some serious environmental conflicts over constructing new pumped storage. Rooftop solar is kind of silly (who wants to have to decided between power and trees?), but mandated solar panels above arterial roads would huge. Power + driving in the shade! When i arrived in malibu, ca I was a conservative. But damn these guys know how to live! They DO seem to defy the rules of economic life, but I think it's because its so sunny and beautiful here nobody ever wants to leave. The economy is always booming. Housing prices are (usually) rising and when they fall (as they do spectacularly) they come back up. Yup, the Democrats are utterly corrupt - and yes, I have personal knowledge that the solar industry here is mostly a jobs machine for connected Dems. Yes, people vote for ridiculous socialistic policies that SHOULD kill the economy. But it...just...doesn't. California haters rage and foam but I gotta tell ya -- they really don't know what's going on here. This state is rocking. People are richer than ever. Yes, yes, it'll all fall down. But when, my angry friends? Soon? People have been saying that since I moved out here in 1993! And I'm having a VERY GOOD RUN. So...lol...I guess the jokes on you, motherfuckers! Agreed. When I first moved to CA, it was the 8th largest economy, now its 5th beating out UK (thanks to foolish Brexit) and France. In that time CA created whole bunch of industries that didn't exist yet like green energy, an electric auto industry, private space travel, social networking, personal communication devices, tech companies galore. Sure Dems are corrupt and clueless, but it turns out that having the right people with the right ideas in your state is more important than who's running the state. People making $30k get priced out and leave but in exchange we get software engineers\/dreamers\/hustlers from the midwest, the south, India, China, all over really. Let's not forget countries that R's might consider too socialist are also doing well like Singapore, Taiwan, Canada, and Scandinavia. Heck, China is doing well and they're Marxist. There's more than one way to run a society but R's are so adamant about forcing their antiquated views on everybody. \"People making $30k get priced out and leave\" CA has the highest poverty rate in the country I know all the Mercatus folks love to talk about SB 827 but you need to give up on that as a vehicle for lowering housing prices (wow, look how cheap the condos are in SoMA SF!).  It would have resulted in developers being able to build more condos in places they've been wanting to build them (e.g., more of SF, Rockridge, Berkeley, Palo Alto, Mt View).  It wouldn't have resulted in much more carfree living, at least until CA has more \"transit hubs\" worthy of the name.  They used that word to sound green, and because \"upzoned site for condos\" sounds unfriendly, but nobody would've been able to live in those places without a car, the way you can in cities with actual mass transit.  Build another BART tunnel from the East Bay and expand the network to more than one line on the peninsula and *maybe* then you can talk about transit-friendly development.  One sad train station does not a transit hub make. Here's a question: What saves\/generates more net energy in a moderately warm semi-inland California environment such as the San Fernando Valley: rooftop solar panels or a shade tree? In other words, under what conditions would it make dollars and cents sense to cut down a shade tree to increase the sunshine falling on your rooftop solar panels? Are you fertilising the tree? The answer to what conditions is presumably \"cool but sunny, with high power prices\" But your point in a very interesting one where I sit here in sunny Bangkok in a small house shaded by trees. Blocking the afternoon sun seems to cut my air con use massively. Another question: I have about a decade left on the 25-year warranty on my fire resistant roof. I've never had a leak in the decade and a half with the new roof, and I'd like to keep it way. How often does installing solar panels compromise the waterproofness of a roof? Tyler is right. Rooftop solar panels are expensive and inefficient... for now. Fortunately, technology doesn't stand still. Look up perovskite solar panels - it's 'version 2.0' solar technology that will be rolled out over the next couple decades. 10x lower capex due to cheaper production processes, higher theoretical efficiency, MUCH lighter (so the installation costs are substantially lower) and flexible, so it can be placed on airplane\/drone wings, car roofs, and anywhere else that a flexible, light, and cheap solar panel would be useful. It's only partly about the cost of the panels. The electronic controls are another cost, and those technologies are mature and not getting cheaper. The result has been the tendency of developers to 'over-panel' - that is, to make the panels over-sized to the electronics. This causes a whole different set of issues for control of the system. As I understand it, when the sun rises in the morning a solar array doesn't produce very small amounts of power that slowly increase as the sun gets higher in the sky. They produce nothing until they reach a voltage level and then they come on with a bang. When you over-panel the bang is larger, so you have to have some other resources that can ease the transition. The same thing happens in reverse when the sun goes down. You could use batteries, but they are very expensive and increase the cost of the solar system pretty dramatically. So even if the panels were free, the cost could, in theory, be prohibitive. There's no bang-bang.  Rooftop solar will typically produce a few watts even before the sun rises in the pre-dawn light and a few watts after the sun sets.  Solar inverters are very good at this and they are continuing to develop and fall in price.  We're seeing price falls every year. I'm in South Australia.  About 7% of the electricity consumed in the state comes from rooftop solar.  We have a lot of rooftop solar because we have high retail electricity prices and we have the lowest cost rooftop solar in the world.  We got the lowest prices due to a lack of red tape compared to the US and subsidies allowed the average household to install solar.  As the average household was price sensitive they looked for the best deals, keeping the installation business competitive.   High levels of sunshine help but a huge number of Americans live in places that receive as much or more sunshine than the average Australian roof. Someone has an axe to grind (is he invested academically in molten salt or something?).  I just had rooftop solar installed, and it's **much** cheaper then the local utility.  I could give up my federal tax credit and it would still be a good deal.  The utility scale solar will only be competitive if there is cheap land available, which doesn't describe that much of California.  Then there are transmission lines to build and all the NIMBYism that surrounds that...  Installing rooftop solar at the time of new construction is just a no brainer.  It's vastly cheaper to run wires on an unfinished house.  I'm pretty sure it would be cost effective without the federal subsidy.  I can somewhat understand the libertarian argument against requiring it, but \/shrug it's California there are a lot dumber laws that could be passed. Bringing up SB827 is a total non-sequitur.  Foolish top-down urbanism lost that round, get over it.  There's no reason at all to link the two issues, other then petulant rock throwing. Isn't all of this analysis done in the context of fossil fuel energy system that is heavily subsidized by defense budgets and other massive cost externalities? I don't know about defense budgets, but if coal generation had to pay to remove the CO2 it emitted into the atmosphere then I think it's likely to add a minimum of 5 cents per kilowatt-hour to its cost.  Paying for the cost of health effects might add another cent, but that may vary considerably from power station to power station depending on location and pollution controls.   This would result in coal being priced out of the market.

If you're an easy sell, full API docs and\ntutorial are already available at\nglom.readthedocs.io. \nHarder sells, this 5-minute post is for you.\nReally hard sells, meet me at PyCon.  In the Python world, there's a saying: \"Flat is better than nested.\" Maybe times have changed or maybe that adage just applies more to code\nthan data. In spite of the warning, nested data continues to grow,\nfrom document stores to RPC systems to structured logs to plain ol'\nJSON web services. After all, if \"flat\" was the be-all-end-all, why would namespaces be\none honking great idea? Nobody likes artificial flatness, nobody wants\nto call a function with 40 arguments. Nested data is tricky though. Reaching into deeply structured data can\nget you some ugly errors. Consider this simple line: That single line can result in at least four different exceptions,\neach less helpful than the last: Clearly, we need our tools to catch up to our nested data. Enter glom. glom is a new approach to working with data in Python, featuring: A tool as simple and powerful as glom attracts many\ncomparisons. While similarities exist, and are often intentional, glom differs from\nother offerings in a few ways: Many nested data tools simply perform deep gets and searches, stopping\nshort after solving the problem posed above. Realizing that access\nalmost always precedes assignment, glom takes the paradigm further,\nenabling total declarative transformation of the data. By way of introduction, let's start off with space-age access, the\nclassic \"deep-get\":  Some quick terminology: With output = glom(target, spec) committed to memory, we're ready\nfor some new requirements. Our astronomers want to focus in on the Solar system, and represent\nplanets as a list. Let's restructure the data to make a list of names: And let's say we want to capture a parallel list of moon counts with\nthe names as well: We can react to changing data requirements as fast as the data itself\ncan change, naturally restructuring our results, despite the input's\nnested nature. Like a list comprehension, but for nested data, our\ncode mirrors our output. And we're just getting started. Most other implementations are limited to a particular data format or\npure model, be it jmespath or\nXPath\/XSLT. glom makes no such sacrifices of\npracticality, harnessing the full power of Python itself. Going back to our example, let's say we wanted to get an aggregate\nmoon count: With glom, you have full access to Python at any given moment. Pass\nvalues to functions, whether built-in, imported, or defined inline\nwith lambda. But glom doesn't stop there. Now we get to one of my favorite features by far. Leaning into\nPython's power, we unlock the following syntax: What just happened? T stands for target, and it acts as your data's stunt\ndouble. T records every key you get, every attribute you\naccess, every index you index, and every method you call. And out\ncomes a spec that's usable like any other. No more worrying if an attribute is None or a key isn't set. Take\nthat leap with T. T never raises an exception, so worst case you\nget a meaningful error message when you run glom() on it. And if you're ok with the data not being there, just set a default: Finally, null-coalescing operators for Python! But so much more. This kind of dynamism is what made me fall in love\nwith Python. No other language could do it quite like this. That's why glom will always be a Python library first and a CLI\nsecond. Oh, didn't I mention there was a CLI? Tools like jq provide a lot of value on the console, but leave a\ndubious path forward for further integration. glom's full-featured\ncommand-line interface is only a stepping stone to using it more\nextensively inside application logic. Which gets us: Piping hot JSON into glom with a cool Python literal spec, with\npretty-printed JSON out. A great way to process and filter API calls,\nand explore some data. Something genuinely enjoyable, because you know\nyou won't be stuck in this pipe dream. Everything on the command line ports directly into production-grade\nPython, complete with better error handling and limitless integration\npossibilities.  Never before glom have I put a piece of code into production so quickly. Within two weeks of the first commit, glom has paid its weight in\ngold, with glom specs replacing Django Rest Framework code 2x\nto 5x their size, making the codebase faster and more\nreadable. Meanwhile, glom's core is so tight that we're on pace to\nhave more docs and tests than code very soon. The glom() function is stable, along with the rest of the API,\nunless otherwise specified. A lot of other features are baking or in the works. For now, we'll\nbe focusing on the following growth areas: We'll be talking about all of this and more at PyCon, so\nswing by if you can. In either case, I hope you'll try glom out and\nlet us know how it goes!

A multi-year engineering project \u2013 started in the AutoCAD team way back when I was part of it \u2013 culminated in its first deliverables getting into the hands (or, in this case, browsers) of customers. The AutoCAD team has been working on a project codenamed \u201cFabric\u201d for the last several years. It's has been a huge amount of work \u2013 something I\u2019ll hopefully get into in a future blog post \u2013 but it\u2019s finally bearing tangible fruit. In broad strokes the work was to take the core of AutoCAD and make it cross-platform. You might consider the Big Split \u2013 work that was done ostensibly to build AutoCAD for Mac but resulted in a Core Engine that became the mechanism through which developers could run custom code in the cloud via AutoCAD I\/O (now part of Forge\u2019s Design Automation API) \u2013 to be the first phase of this effort. At the very least Fabric stood on the shoulders of the Big Split. The Big Split was a significant effort that resulted in code that could be cross-compiled on both Windows and OS X. It did so via various techniques, some of which were less than ideal with the benefit of hindsight (such as using #ifdef statements in various places to have conditional compilation on the two platforms). Fabric has done away with #ifdefs, forcing any platform-specific code into a PAL (Platform Abstraction Layer) per targeted platform. And Fabric is able to target more than just Windows and OS X. Some of the main targets were the established mobile platforms (more on that down the line), but one major effort was to target the web platform with the AutoCAD codebase. Yes, you read that right\u2026 yesterday\u2019s update to AutoCAD Web now runs the same core code as standard AutoCAD, but in a browser. A major part of AutoCAD\u2019s C++ codebase gets run through Emscripten (at least that\u2019s my understanding \u2013 I\u2019ll correct any details I get wrong) to be transpiled into WebAssembly. This is huge. We\u2019re finally able to have a single codebase that results in the same AutoCAD core technology working inside a web browser.  There are still significant gaps between the browser-based version of AutoCAD and its desktop-based sibling \u2013 3D being a prime example \u2013 but these gaps will reduce, over time. It will also be much easier for the AutoCAD team to build new features that work across the range of AutoCAD\u2019s platforms. An interesting anecdote is around the recently discovered processor vulnerabilities \u2013 Meltdown and Spectre \u2013 and the impact these had on the project. Support for WebAssembly in modern browsers required the use of SharedArrayBuffers \u2013 a technology that\u2019s vulnerable to Spectre. The AutoCAD team worked with the Chrome team to identify an alternative approach: after some nervous weeks of people having to use browser flags to force the availability of SharedArrayBuffers, AutoCAD Web once again works as well as it did before the vulnerability was discovered. In an upcoming post I\u2019ll talk more about the Fabric project, and what was involved: I know this blog\u2019s readership will find the details interesting. The important thing for me in this whole effort is that it brings significant potential for a future where external apps and customizations could work on a wide range of platforms. This would be nirvana for developers who have spent many years investing in building desktop-centric knowledge and intellectual property. This isn\u2019t necessarily something that\u2019s coming in the near-term, but the promise is there, and it\u2019s very exciting. Update: I\u2019ve received some clarification from the AutoCAD team about the use of SharedArrayBuffers in WebAssembly. Apparently they\u2019re not strictly required for WebAssembly to function (of course), but we originally used them to support certain synchronous retrieval operations the AutoCAD codebase has to perform.

But with the planet in the grip of its sixth mass extinction event, it has never been a more pressing priority.  To unlock nature\u2019s secrets, ecologists turn to a variety of scientific instruments and tools. Sometimes we even repurpose household items, with eyebrow-raising results \u2013 whether it\u2019s using a tea strainer to house ants, or tackling botfly larvae with a well-aimed dab of nail polish.  But there are many more high-tech options becoming available for studying the natural world. In fact, ecology is on the cusp of a revolution, with new and emerging technologies opening up new possibilities for insights into nature and applications for conserving biodiversity.        Our study, published in the journal Ecosphere, tracks the progress of this technological development. Here we highlight a few examples of these exciting advances. Electronically recording the movement of animals was first made possible by VHF radio telemetry in the 1960s. Since then even more species, especially long-distance migratory animals such as caribou, shearwaters and sea turtles, have been tracked with the help of GPS and other satellite data.  But our understanding of what affects animals\u2019 movement and other behaviours, such as hunting, is being advanced further still by the use of \u201cbio-logging\u201d \u2013 equipping the animals themselves with miniature sensors. Many types of miniature sensors have now been developed, including accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, micro cameras, and barometers. Together, these devices make it possible to track animals\u2019 movements with unprecedented precision. We can also now measure the \u201cphysiological cost\u201d of behaviours \u2013 that is, whether an animal is working particularly hard to reach a destination, or within a particular location, to capture and consume its prey.  Taken further, placing animal movement paths within spatially accurate 3D-rendered (computer-generated) environments will allow ecologists to examine how individuals respond to each other and their surroundings.  These devices could also help us determine whether animals are changing their behaviour in response to threats such as invasive species or habitat modification. In turn, this could tell us what conservation measures might work best. Remotely piloted vehicles, including drones, are now a common feature of our skies, land, and water. Beyond their more typical recreational uses, ecologists are deploying autonomous vehicles to measure environments, observe species, and assess changes through time, all with a degree of detail that was never previously possible.  Coupling autonomous vehicles with sensors (such as thermal imaging) now makes it easier to observe rare, hidden or nocturnal species. It also potentially allows us to catch poachers red-handed, which could help to protect animals like rhinoceros, elephants and pangolins. Despite 3D printing having been pioneered in the 1980s, we are only now beginning to realise the potential uses for ecological research. For instance, it can be used to make cheap, lightweight tracking devices that can be fitted onto animals. Or it can be used to create complex and accurate models of plants, animals or other organisms, for use in behavioural studies. Keeping electronic equipment running in the field can be a challenge. Conventional batteries have limited life spans, and can contain toxic chemicals. Solar power can help with some of these problems, but not in dimly lit areas, such as deep in the heart of rainforests.  \u201cBio-batteries\u201d may help to overcome this challenge. They convert naturally occurring sources of chemical energy, such as starch, into electricity using enzymes. \u201cPlugging-in\u201d to trees may allow sensors and other field equipment to be powered cheaply for a long time in places without sun or access to mains electricity. All of the technologies described above sit on a continuum from previous (now largely mainstream) technological solutions, to new and innovative ones now being trialled.  Emerging technologies are exciting by themselves, but when combined with one another they can revolutionise ecological research. Here is a modified exerpt from our paper:  Imagine research stations fitted with remote cameras and acoustic recorders equipped with low-power computers for image and animal call recognition, powered by trees via bio-batteries. These devices could use low-power, long-range telemetry both to communicate with each other in a network, potentially tracking animal movement from one location to the next, and to transmit information to a central location. Swarms of drones working together could then be deployed to map the landscape and collect data from a central location wirelessly, without landing. The drones could then land in a location with an internet connection and transfer data into cloud-based storage, accessible from anywhere in the world. These advancements will not only generate more accurate research data, but should also minimise the disturbance to species and ecosystems in the process.  Not only will this minimise the stress to animals and the inadvertent spread of diseases, but it should also provide a more \u201cnatural\u201d picture of how plants, animals and other organisms interact. \n\n\n      Read more:\n      'Epic Duck Challenge' shows drones can outdo people at surveying wildlife\n\n\n Realising the techno-ecological revolution will require better collaboration across disciplines and industries. Ecologists should ideally also be exposed to relevant technology-based training (such as engineering or IT) and industry placements early in their careers.  Several initiatives, such as Wildlabs, the Conservation Technology Working Group and TechnEcology, are already addressing these needs. But we are only just at the start of what\u2019s ultimately possible.

Even though Apple\u2019s developer conference is still a few weeks away, I think it\u2019s safe to say that the demo of Google Duplex at yesterday\u2019s Google I\/O keynote will go down as the most impressive of the tech conference season. If you haven\u2019t seen it, it is a must-watch: Once I picked my jaw up off the floor, though, what struck me about Google CEO Sundar Pichai\u2019s presentation was how he opened the segment: \n  Our vision for our assistant is to help you get things done.\n And how he closed it: \n  A common theme across all this is we are working hard to give users back time. We\u2019ve always been obsessed about that at Google. Search is obsessed about getting users to answers quickly and giving them what they want.\n In Google\u2019s view, computers help you get things done \u2014 and save you time \u2014 by doing things for you. Duplex was the most impressive example \u2014 a computer talking on the phone for you \u2014 but the general concept applied to many of Google\u2019s other demonstrations, particularly those predicated on AI: Google Photos will not only sort and tag your photos, but now propose specific edits; Google News will find your news for you, and Maps will find you new restaurants and shops in your neighborhood. And, appropriately enough, the keynote closed with a presentation from Waymo, which will drive you. Rewind a week, and there was a specific section in Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s keynote at the Facebook F8 conference that stuck out to me: \n  I believe that we need to design technology to help bring people closer together. And I believe that that\u2019s not going to happen on it\u2019s own. So to do that, part of the solution, just part of it, is that one day more of our technology is going to need to focus on people and our relationships. Now there\u2019s no guarantee that we get this right. This is hard stuff. We will make mistakes and they will have consequences and we will need to fix them. But what I can guarantee is that if we don\u2019t work on this the world isn\u2019t moving in this direction by itself.\n Zuckerberg, as so often seems to be the case with Facebook, comes across as a somewhat more fervent and definitely more creepy version of Google: not only does Facebook want to do things for you, it wants to do things its chief executive explicitly says would not be done otherwise. The Messianic fervor that seems to have overtaken Zuckerberg in the last year, though, simply means that Facebook has adopted a more extreme version of the same philosophy that guides Google: computers doing things for people. Earlier this week, while delivering Microsoft\u2019s Build conference keynote, CEO Satya Nadella struck a very different tone; after describing how computing was becoming invisible, because it is everywhere, Nadella said: \n  That\u2019s the opportunity that we have. It\u2019s in some sense endless, but we also have responsibility. We have the responsibility to ensure that these technologies are empowering everyone, these technologies are creating equitable growth by ensuring that every industry is able to grow and create employment. But we also have a responsibility as a tech industry to build trust in technology.   In fact Hans Jonas was a philosopher who worked in the 50s, 60s, and he wrote a paper on technology and responsibility\u2026he talks about act so that the effects of your action are compatible with permanence or genuine life. That\u2019s something that we need to reflect on, because he was talking about the power of technology being such that it far outstrips our ability to completely control it, especially its impact even on future generations. And so we need to develop a set of principles that guide the choices we make because the choices we make is what\u2019s going to define the future\u2026   This opportunity and responsibility is what grounds us in our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We\u2019re focused on building technology so that we can empower others to build more technology. We\u2019ve aligned our mission, the products we build, our business model, so that your success is what leads to our success. There\u2019s got to be complete alignment.\n This is technology\u2019s second philosophy, and it is very much in opposition to the other: the expectation is not that the computer does your work for you, but rather that the computer enables you to do your work better and more efficiently. And, with this philosophy, comes a different take on responsibility. Pichai, in the opening of Google\u2019s keynote, acknowledged that \u201cwe feel a deep sense of responsibility to get this right\u201d, but inherent in that statement is the centrality of Google generally and the direct culpability of its managers. Nadella, on the other hand, insists that responsibility lies with the tech industry collectively, and all of us who seek to leverage it individually. This second philosophy, that computers are an aid to humans, not their replacement, is the older of the two; its greatest proponent \u2014 prophet, if you will \u2014 was Microsoft\u2019s greatest rival, and his analogy of choice was, coincidentally enough, about transportation as well. Not a car, but a bicycle: Steve Jobs was exceptionally fond of this analogy: there are multiple clips of him making the point in mostly the same way; I usually link to this one because by the time this video was recorded1 Jobs had his delivery perfectly honed. Interestingly, though, the earliest known clip of Jobs telling this story, from 1980, doesn\u2019t include the famous phrase \u201cBicycle of the Mind\u201d; it\u2019s worth watching, though, all the same: \n  The best analogy I\u2019ve ever heard is Scientific American, I think it was, did a study in the early 70s on the efficiency of locomotion, and what they did was for all different species of things in the planet, birds and cats and dogs and fish and goats and stuff, they measured how much energy does it take for a goat to get from here to there. Kilocalories per kilometer or something, I don\u2019t know what they measured. And they ranked them, they published the list, and the Condor won. The Condor took the least amount of energy to get from here to there. Man was didn\u2019t do so well, came in with a rather unimpressive showing about a third of the way down the list.   But fortunately someone at Scientific American was insightful enough to test a man with a bicycle, and man with a bicycle won. Twice as good as the Condor, all the way off the list. And what it showed was that man is a toolmaker, has the ability to make a tool to amplify an inherent ability that he has. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing here.\n This is precisely what Nadella was driving at: \u201cto empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more\u201d is to \u201camplify an inherent ability\u201d those people and organizations have; the goal is not to do things for them, but to enable them to do things never before possible. And, I would hasten to add, Apple remains very much on the same side of this philosophical divide. There is certainly an argument to be made that these two philosophies arise out of their historical context; it is no accident that Apple and Microsoft, the two \u201cbicycle of the mind\u201d companies, were founded only a year apart, and for decades had broadly similar business models: sure, Microsoft licensed software, while Apple sold software-differentiated hardware, but both were and are at their core personal computer companies and, by extension, platforms.  Google and Facebook, on the other hand, are products of the Internet, and the Internet leads not to platforms but to aggregators. While platforms need 3rd parties to make them useful and build their moat through the creation of ecosystems, aggregators attract end users by virtue of their inherent usefulness and, over time, leave suppliers no choice but to follow the aggregators\u2019 dictates if they wish to reach end users.  The business model follows from these fundamental differences: a platform provider has no room for ads, because the primary function of a platform is provide a stage for the applications that users actually need to shine. Aggregators, on the other hand, particularly Google and Facebook, deal in information, and ads are simply another type of information.2 Moreover, because the critical point of differentiation for aggregators is the number of users on their platform, advertising is the only possible business model; there is no more important feature when it comes to widespread adoption than being \u201cfree.\u201d Still, that doesn\u2019t make the two philosophies any less real: Google and Facebook have always been predicated on doing things for the user, just as Microsoft and Apple have been built on enabling users and developers to make things completely unforeseen. That there are two philosophies does not necessarily mean that one is right and one is wrong: the reality is we need both. Some problems are best solved by human ingenuity, enabled by the likes of Microsoft and Apple; others by collective action. That, though, gets at why Google and Facebook are fundamentally more dangerous: collective action is traditionally the domain of governments, the best form of which is bounded by the popular will. Google and Facebook, on the other hand, are accountable to no one. Both deserve all of the recent scrutiny they have attracted, and arguably deserve more. That scrutiny, though, and whatever regulations that result, must keep in mind this philosophical divide: platforms that create new possibilities \u2014 and not just Apple and Microsoft! \u2014 are the single most important economic force when it comes to countering the oncoming wave of computers doing people\u2019s jobs, and lazily written regulation that targets aggregators but constricts platforms will inevitably do more harm than good. The truth is that the Divine Discontent that I wrote about last week is not only an antidote to low-end disruption, but also a reason for optimism: companies like Apple and Amazon can, as I noted, win in the long run by offering a superior user experience, but more importantly, the dividend of discontent is a greenfield of opportunities to build new businesses and new jobs alleviating that discontent. For that we need platforms on which to build those businesses, and yes, we will need artificial intelligence to do things for us so we have the time.","time":1525878138,"title":"Tech\u2019s Two Philosophies","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/stratechery.com\/2018\/techs-two-philosophies\/","label":7,"label_name":"random"},{"by":"bko","descendants":12,"id":17029430,"kids":"[17030098, 17031292, 17030713, 17030585, 17030180]","score":97,"text":"In my last post I wrote about the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model used for object detection. The most surprising thing when reading the paper was how clever and relatively simple the model is. The strength lies in the fact that the model only passes through the image once and from that single pass, is able to detect a number of objects. The architecture also allows mini versions with fewer layers, a smaller size but similar performance. In fact, the model is so small it can run offline on a weak device such as a rapberry pi. This is just what I did. I have two cats and I wanted to track their whereabouts when I was not at home. So I setup a raspberry pi to take periodically take a picture, detect the picture for objects and save the object locations down to a json file. After the objects were processed, I then wrote a script that applies a kind of heatmap on a base image with where the provided objects were over all the logs. The project requires tensorflow, keras, numpy and matplotlib to be installed on your raspberry pi. I have some notes below on getting those installed. Below will set everything up and take a photo every minute until stopped, detect object and save them in json format in the logs directory. Once enough logs are saved, the below will convert the logs from the log directory and overlay the objects onto the input image. The object value has to be an object that the model was trained on, which is visible from the\u00a0.classes file in the model directory. The most frustrating part was getting tensorflow and Keras to run on raspberry pi. Not because the pi is not powerful enough, but the standard methods to install tensorflow did not work for me (e.g. pip) and there is less support for weaker ARM hardware. I was able to install the tensorflow for python 2.7, but 3.4+ was not working for me. I won\u2019t discuss it here in length, but here are the links that worked for me. The first step is being able to detect the images. I wrote at length in my last post about how object detection works, so I won\u2019t go over much here. The file detect.py has a function called detect_from_image that creates the model based on provided config file and weights. The model takes about a minute to load from the config and weights (raspberry pi v3), but it only needs to load once. The function then runs the image through the model and parses out the response, maps the object output to their respective class names and re-scales the response to the original image size and returns a dictionary of the objects detected. Below is the signature of the main function in detect: The image can either be a string with the image path or a PIL.Image object. The anchors_path is a list to the location of the anchors. The anchors are space separated values in a text file. The anchors for yolov2 are as follows: You can read more about anchors in my last post under \u201cClustering Box Dimensions with Anchors\u201d. The classes_path just lists the classes that the model was trained on in a space separated text file. The config_path holds the config file of the model. I tried saving the compiled model in\u00a0.h5 format, but it caused a memory crash on my raspberry pi (v3). So I had to recreate the model every time through the config file and weights. I borrowed code from the great package yad2k (Yet Another Darknet 2 Keras), but judging by the name, there are other options to convert the model to Keras. The weights_path is a path to the weights. The weights are too large to host on github, but they can be found here. min_confidence is the minimum confidence level required to have the model detect and save down the location of an object. I found 50% works well max_overlap is the maximum amount of overlap allowed by the same object. The way that YOLO works means that the same object is likely to be detected several times with overlapping rectangles. In this case, you have to decide if the same object overlaps X% (intersection over union), then just take the object with a higher confidence level. If you set this too low, then you may not detect multiple objects of the same type if they are near each other. If set too high, then you may detect the same object multiple times. I found 0.35 to work well for my purposes. model_image_size is the size to rescale your image before running it through the network. I found (608,608) to work well. The final output of the function will be similar to below and scaled to the original image size. The tracking takes place in track.py. The file is fairly simple. Tracking can be accessed as follows: interval is the interval in minutes in which you want a picture to be taken start is the minutes delay before starting the tracking end is the minutes after the start that you want the pictures to be taken directory is the directory that you want the json logs to be saved vflip|hflip is a flag that tells the camera to vertically|horizontally flip the pictures taken The file is short enough that its worth looking at in its entirety: The final step is converting the logs into heat-maps dir is the directory of the log (json) files that contain the object locations output is the output of the final image input is the base image to be drawn over alpha is the redness of the alpha of the circles detecting the objects (higher is darker) object is the object that you want to detect. If you have a lot of objects detected over a long period of time, you would want to set the alpha to be low, and vice versa. I didn\u2019t run this long enough to capture any interesting cat location analytics but below is a the final output detecting the placement of cups in my living room throughout the day. The code for the heatmap was taken from the github answer on a similar question. It is more of a hack and can definitely be improved. The underlying picture becomes faded and its sometimes tricky to get the right alpha balance but it serves its purpose here. A lot of people in the machine learning space are trying to sell you an API and real-time object detection using freely available models developed by others. The fact is that for many applications, you don\u2019t need real-time detection and the models are small enough to run anywhere. It may take you 30 seconds to evaluate the image, but that\u2019s fine for many purposes. This functionality is very low cost, secure and respectful of privacy. The fact that its cheap to build, relatively simple, fully customizable and able to run offline puts it at an advantage over many more expensive cloud services. Discussion can be found at hacker news. By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

Argentine entrepreneur Wences Casares has spent the past several years persuading Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires that Bitcoin is the global currency of the future, that they need to buy some, and that he\u2019s the man to safeguard it. His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker. Wences Casares In the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security. But one secret has proven elusive: how much digital cash does it really hold? Two Xapo clients said it houses roughly $10 billion of Bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoin\u2019s price, after all, is hardly steady. Even in the colorful world of crypto the cache is remarkable -- amounting to about 7 percent of the global Bitcoin supply. It would mean Xapo, just 4 years old, has more \u201cdeposits\u201d than 98 percent of the roughly 5,670 banks in the U.S. But as a custodian it\u2019s regulated differently. The Swiss subsidiary is overseen by the self-regulating Financial Services Standards Association, which audits members to ensure they comply with anti-money-laundering rules. Xapo serves U.S. customers through a Delaware corporation that\u2019s registered with the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and is licensed in several states. The outsize holdings underscore the faith that Casares -- a serial entrepreneur nicknamed \u201cPatient Zero\u201d for stirring Silicon Valley\u2019s interest in Bitcoin -- has garnered among his acolytes and at major crypto investment firms, such as Grayscale and CoinShares. \u201cEveryone who isn\u2019t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo,\u201d said Ryan Radloff of CoinShares, which has more than $500 million of Bitcoin stored at Xapo. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t pay me to keep it with a bank.\u201d Xapo\u2019s vault in Switzerland See also: Buffett, Gates are latest Bitcoin critics, halting $10,000 Push Xapo\u2019s billionaire backers include LinkedIn Corp. co-founder Reid Hoffman and former Wall Street trader Mike Novogratz, who\u2019s in the process of setting up his own cryptocurrency merchant bank. Their bet is that Bitcoin is here to stay, and so is its biggest scourge, theft. The first rule of owning Bitcoin is to securely keep your private key -- the code that lets you spend your coins. If thieves get it, they can loot your holdings in an instant, with no hope of recovery. Putting keys on a device connected to the Internet is both convenient and perilous: Hackers have proven adept at obtaining them from afar. The most popular alternative is called cold storage, keeping the key in an offline device such as a thumb drive. But risks remain: Hackers have also proven adept at setting traps on computers to access cold-storage devices the moment they\u2019re online. More traditional criminals have committed home invasions and kidnappings. Some Bitcoin tycoons have resorted to hiding their identities, fortifying their homes and studying self-defense. Xapo\u2019s solution is to bury a cold-storage device in a mountainside and layer on electronic safeguards. \u201cThey\u2019re the first folks who recognized custodial and security functions would be key,\u201d said Hoffman, whose venture capital firm Greylock Partners led a $20 million investment in Xapo in 2014, a couple of years after Casares persuaded him to buy his first Bitcoin. \u201cHe made the pitch in the morning and in the afternoon I called him with an offer.\u201d At Xapo, retrieving Bitcoin from the vault takes about two days. The company verifies a client\u2019s identity and authenticates the request before manually signing the transactions with private keys from multiple vault locations. Approval from three separate vaults is required for any transactions to be authorized. The company also offers customers a trading desk to buy and sell Bitcoin and created the first Bitcoin debit card to spend it. Casares, 44, declined to comment for this story. After a flurry of publicity at Xapo\u2019s launch, he has drawn big audiences at crypto conferences but largely shunned media interviews.

His evangelizing of Bitcoin is so pervasive in Silicon Valley that when Hoffman asked his family office to buy some, his banker asked when he\u2019d spoken to Casares. Xapo\u2019s advisers now include former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, ex-Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Officer John Reed and Visa International founder Dee Hock. Such salesmanship has been critical to Xapo\u2019s success. First Block Capital, Canada\u2019s first fully registered crypto firm, picked Xapo as its custodian after months of due diligence, including touring the Swiss vault. \u201cEvery part of their DNA is geared to security,\u201d said Sean Clark, First Block\u2019s founder, who noted the vault\u2019s fingerprint scanners were equipped with a pulse reader to prevent amputated hands from being used. \u201cWhenever we make big transfers they FaceTime us, we have duress words, if it\u2019s big enough they\u2019ll fly out to see us.\u201d Xapo is doubling down on its pursuit of institutional clients, with President Ted Rogers enlisting Peter Najarian, a veteran of emerging-market trading at UBS Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, to oversee outreach to investors including pension funds, private banks, assets managers, family offices and hedge funds. The perceived lack of an institutional-grade custodial solution for Bitcoin has been one of the sticking points for many money managers looking to try the asset class. Xapo says its already offering precisely that solution. If it persuades them of its merits, the implications for Bitcoin would be profound. \u201cA fraction of that kind of institutional money flowing into the space would be a tidal wave,\u201d Najarian said.

Born to sheep ranchers in Argentina\u2019s remote Patagonia region, he experienced the impact of inflation throughout his youth. That drove him to build a series of fintech startups that made him millions before he encountered Bitcoin. He sold 75 percent of Patagon, a Latin American financial-services website, for $529 million in 2000 and digital wallet startup Lemon for $43 million 13 years later to focus on crypto. By then, he was already a big holder of Bitcoin. \u201cI am personally allocating a percentage of my net worth to this that is borderline irresponsible because I believe in it so much,\u201d Casares told Lemon board member Eric O\u2019Brien, according to \u201cDigital Gold,\u201d a book by Nathaniel Popper. Two years ago, he joined the board of PayPal Holdings Inc. Bitcoin\u2019s meteoric rise in recent years has spurred the proliferation of rival currencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple that also have multibillion-dollar valuations.

Horseshoe crabs are sometimes called \u201cliving fossils\u201d because they have been around in some form for more than 450 million years. In this time, the Earth has gone through multiple major ice ages, a Great Dying, the formation and subsequent breaking up of Pangaea, and an asteroid impact that killed the dinosaurs and most of life on Earth yet again. In other words, horseshoe crabs have truly seen some shit. Yet, I would conjecture, some of their strangest experiences must have come in just the past few decades, as one of the soft-bodied mammals that came after dinosaurs began using their hands to scoop horseshoe crabs out of the ocean en masse. Contemporary humans do not deliberately kill the horseshoe crabs\u2014as did previous centuries of farmers catching them for fertilizer or fishermen using them as bait. Instead, they scrub the crabs clean of barnacles, fold their hinged carapaces, and stick stainless steel needles into a soft, weak spot, in order to draw blood. Horseshoe crab blood runs blue and opaque, like antifreeze mixed with milk. And for what exactly do humans need the blood of a living fossil? A sort of witchcraft, you might say, for it literally keeps people alive. Horseshoe-crab blood is exquisitely sensitive to toxins from bacteria. It is used to test for contamination during the manufacture of anything that might go inside the human body: every shot, every IV drip, and every implanted medical device. So reliant is the modern biomedical industry on this blood that the disappearance of horseshoe crabs would instantly cripple it. And in recent years, horseshoe crabs, particularly in Asia, have come under a number of threats: habitat loss as seawalls replace the beaches where they spawn, pollution, overfishing for use as food and bait. Horseshoe crabs bled for the biomedical use in the United States are returned to the ocean, but an estimated 50,000 also die in the process every year. There is another way though\u2014a way for modern medicine to make use of modern technology rather than the blood of an ancient animal. A synthetic substitute for horseshoe-crab blood has been available for 15 years. This is a story about how scientists quietly managed to outdo millions of years of evolution, and why it has taken the rest of the world so long to catch up. Jeak Ling Ding says she was \u201calways a lab rat\u201d\u2014the kind of biologist who wore white coats rather than the kind who waded into mud. Yet, in the mid-1980s, she found herself squelching through mud in search of horseshoe crabs. The estuary where they lived, she recalls in understated fashion, was \u201cnot very sweet smelling at all.\u201d Ding, along with her husband and research partner Bow Ho, had come to horseshoe crabs circuitously, and their ultimate goal was to make the animals no longer necessary in biomedical research. At the time, she was a molecular biologist at the National University of Singapore, and a hospital\u2019s in-vitro-fertilization department had come to Ding and Ho with a problem: Their embryos would not survive long enough\u2014could it be because of bacterial contamination? A standard test at the time\u2014and now\u2014is LAL, which stands for limulus amebocyte lysate. Limulus refers to Limulus polyphemus, the species of horseshoe crab native to the Atlantic coast of North America. Amebocyte refers to cells in the crab\u2019s blood. And lysate is the material freed from the cells once they have been \u201clysed\u201d or broken. This is the stuff exquisitely sensitive to bacterial toxins. The first person to figure this out about LAL was Frederik Bang. Thirty years before Ding\u2014and 9,000 miles away on Cape Cod\u2014he too was collecting horseshoe crabs on the shore. (For reasons not entirely understood, horseshoe crabs are only found around the eastern coasts of North America and Asia.) Bang, a pathologist, was interested in the creature\u2019s primitive immune system. He settled on a protocol of injecting bacteria from seawater directly into horseshoe crabs, which cause their blood to clump into \u201cstringy masses.\u201d Bang suspected this clotting had a purpose. It immobilized the bacteria, sealing off the rest of the horseshoe crab\u2019s body from an invading pathogen. Intriguingly, their blood turned to gel even if he boiled the bacteria injection for five or 10 minutes first. This should have killed the bacteria and sterilized the injected solution. Bang realized the blood was sensitive not just to live bacteria but to bacterial toxins that persist even after sterilization. The human immune system may be much more sophisticated than a horseshoe crab\u2019s, but it too reacts to these toxins. Doctors first realized this in the late 19th century, where patients given sterile shots nevertheless came down with \u201cinjection fever\u201d or \u201csaline fever.\u201d In the worst cases, the toxins can cause septic shock and even death. At the time Bang was doing this research in the 1950s, the standard way to test for bacterial toxins was to inject a sample into rabbits. It required someone to come check the rabbits\u2019 temperatures every 30 minutes for three hours for signs of fever, which would suggest bacterial contamination. Under the microscope, the rabbit\u2019s blood cells also had a tendency to clump around the toxin, a similarity Bang noted in his 1956 paper on horseshoe-crab blood. Over the next decade and a half, he and a young pathologist named Jack Levin devised a standardized way to extract LAL. It was not until 1977, however, that the Food and Drug Administration allowed pharmaceutical companies to replace their large colonies of rabbits with LAL kits. Now you simply added LAL to the tested material and flipped the vial over to see if it turned solid\u2014much faster and more convenient. The LAL test still required the use of animals, but the grisly process of sticking needles into animals became hidden and outsourced to a different part of the supply chain. By the time Ding was looking for horseshoe crabs in Singapore, LAL had become a multimillion-dollar industry. One quart of horseshoe-crab blood is reportedly worth as much as $15,000. And the LAL kits she needed to test contamination of IVF embryos were far too expensive. One kit, she recalls, cost $1,000 for her in Singapore. Which is why she considered making her own lysate. But the horseshoe-crab species she was studying in Singapore, Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda, is much smaller than Atlantic horseshoe crabs, and they couldn\u2019t be bled much without dying. So Ding set out to make an alternative to LAL that eventually wouldn\u2019t require horseshoe crabs at all. What it would require was manipulating DNA. Her idea was to splice the horseshoe-crab gene responsible for LAL\u2019s toxin-hunting ability into cells that grow easily in a lab, like yeast. Biotechnology as a field was already moving in the direction of recombinant DNA, which entails taking DNA from one species and putting it another. A few years earlier in 1982, Eli Lilly began selling human insulin grown in vats of bacteria. Ding had a good starting point for her LAL alternative. By then, scientists had identified factor C, the specific molecule in LAL that detects bacterial toxins. So she started hunting for the gene that makes factor C. Her research team took cells from horseshoe crabs that they collected and bled them minimally. (They also tried, but failed, to grow horseshoe crabs in a lab and breed them through IVF.) The horseshoe crab\u2019s sensitivity to bacterial toxins unfortunately also made it a pain to study. The toxins, it turns out, are everywhere\u2014in water, in test tubes, in petri dishes. \u201cYou have to bake all bakeable glassware at 200 to 220 degrees for several hours.\u201d says Ding. They also had to buy special water that had been treated to be bacterial toxin free. If you weren\u2019t careful, your tube of solution could easily turn to gel. When Ding and Ho finally identified the gene for factor C, they spliced it into yeast. That failed because while the yeast made factor C, it did not secrete the molecule. \u201cThe yeast was very difficult to break open. It was very impure and messy,\u201d she says. They tried another type of yeast and mammalian cells\u2014those failed too. In the late 1990s, Ding and Ho attended a course in the United States and learned about baculovirus vector systems. Here, a virus is used to insert the factor C into insect gut cells, turning them into little factories for the molecule. Insects and horseshoes have a shared evolutionary lineage: They\u2019re both arthropods. And these cells worked marvelously. Finally, a decade and a half after she began, Ding had an alternative to LAL that worked without harming any more horseshoe crabs. She cooped herself up in the library to study patents and drafted the application herself. Then she sent it off and waited for the world to change. The world did not change, at least not for the horseshoe crabs. It took three years for the first recombinant factor C test kit based on Ding\u2019s patent to come out in 2003, but even then pharmaceutical companies showed little interest. The companies had a number of reasons. There was only one supplier of the kit, a company that today is part of the Switzerland-based chemicals company Lonza. Pharmaceutical companies were wary of relying on a single source for such an important part of their manufacturing. What if something happened to Lonza? Or a natural disaster hit its production plant? Companies that bleed crabs also stand to lose a lot of money if factor C becomes adopted widely. Of the six companies with crab-bleeding facilities in the United States, two declined interviews, one did not respond to an interview request, and two have virtually no public presence. The sixth is Lonza, which currently sells both LAL and the recombinant factor. Lonza, for its part, blamed the slow uptake on regulations. In the United States, the FDA tells companies carrying out bacterial-toxin tests to follow the United States Pharmacopeia, a handbook that lays out drug standards. In a 2012 guidance, the FDA said companies could use recombinant factor C, which does not appear in the Pharmacopeia, if they carried out their own validation tests. \u201cThe risk is, of course, the FDA may not accept your validation and you can\u2019t bring your product to market,\u201d says Lonza\u2019s spokesperson Katrin Hoeck. \u201cPharmaceutical companies are risk-averse.\u201d It took the industry decades to move from rabbits to LAL, too. The realities of business came as a real disappointment to Ding. \u201cWe were just so keen as researchers, so happy it is working,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we thought the recombinant factor C will be adopted around the world, and the horseshoe crab would be saved.\u201d Recently, however, a few things have changed the recent risk-reward calculus for pharmaceutical companies. For one, Lonza is no longer the sole supplier. In 2013, Hyglos became the second company to make recombinant factor C. Kevin Williams, a senior scientist at Hyglos, says he sees as a long overdue modernization: Pharmaceutical companies stopped relying on pigs and started making insulin in yeast and bacterial cells decades ago. Why can\u2019t the same technology be applied to the very test used to check that insulin is safe for injection? On the regulatory side, the European Pharmacopoeia added recombinant factor C as an accepted bacterial-toxin test in 2016, paving the way for change in the United States. A number of pharmaceutical companies, most notably Eli Lilly, have compared the effectiveness of recombinant factor C and LAL. Jay Bolden, an expert in bacterial toxin detection at Eli Lilly, recalls Lonza coming in their labs with the recombinant factor C kit over a decade ago. He was intrigued at the time but not yet willing to take the plunge. The turning point came in 2013, when Eli Lilly began planning an insulin-manufacturing facility in China, where the native horseshoe-crab species has been declining. \u201cYou would hear things about someday the horseshoe crab might get restricted,\u201d says Bolden. In contrast, the supply chain for recombinant factor C looked more secure with both Hyglos and Lonza as suppliers. LAL and factor C are also comparable in cost. Bolden says Eli Lilly decided to \u201cdraw a line in the sand\u201d: All new products after a certain point would be tested with recombinant factor C. The company recently submitted to the FDA its first application for a drug\u2014galcanezumab to prevent migraines\u2014where the final drug will be quality tested with factor C. It has also looked into using recombinant factor C during the manufacturing process to test water and equipment, which currently accounts for the vast majority of LAL use. Bolden says Eli Lilly has been lobbying the U.S. Pharmacopeia to include recombinant factor C. On Thursday, Bolden will be speaking in Cape May, New Jersey, at an event organized by Revive & Restore, a nonprofit best known for its work on bringing extinct species back to life. \u201cOur mission is to use biotech for conservation,\u201d says Ryan Phelan, the co-founder and executive director of Revive & Restore. Phelan first met Ding when she traveled to Singapore for a synthetic-biology conference in 2017, and she realized her research on recombinant factor C sat perfectly in the intersection of conservation and biotechnology. Revive & Restore and its conservation partners\u2014New Jersey Audubon, American Littoral Society, and Delaware River Keeper Network\u2014chose the Cape May location because horseshoe crabs come here every spring to spawn. You can no longer catch horseshoe crabs here due to their importance to a threatened migratory bird species called the red knot. These birds show up here in the spring, too. Their migration is timed so that birds flying from South America to the Arctic can gorge themselves on the caviar-like horseshoe-crab eggs. The beaches turn black with crabs, their shells clickety-clacking as females scramble to lay their eggs and males to fertilize them. The red knots scramble to eat. They nearly double in weight for their journey to the Arctic. It is an ancient synchrony between species, one that began long before humans began harvesting horseshoe crabs for blood and will hopefully last long after. \n    Jeff VanderMeer discusses how writing fiction about environmental crises may jolt readers out of complacency.\n A recent spate of #MeToo stories serves as yet another reminder of the centrifugal forces of talented men. On Monday evening, The New Yorker published yet more proof that the #MeToo moment continues apace: a report containing the testimony of four women accusing the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, of a range of physical and emotional abuses. The story, under the powerhouse co-byline of Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow, was striking\u2014and nauseating\u2014for several reasons, among them allegations of hitting, of threatening, of racism. One of the other reasons, though, was this line: \u201cAfter the former girlfriend ended the relationship, she told several friends about the abuse. A number of them advised her to keep the story to herself, arguing that Schneiderman was too valuable a politician for the Democrats to lose.\u201d Kanye West wants freedom\u2014white freedom.

Yes, it had to have happened like this, like folk wisdom, because when I think of that era, I do not think of MTV, but of the futile attempt to stay awake and navigate the yawning whiteness of Friday Night Videos, and I remember that there were no VCRs among us then, and so it would have had to have been there that I saw it, in the auditorium that adjoined the cafeteria, where after the daily serving of tater tots and chocolate milk, a curtain divider was pulled back and all the kids stormed the stage. And I would have been there among them, awkwardly uprocking, or worming in place, or stiffly snaking, or back-spinning like a broken rotor, and I would have looked up and seen a kid, slightly older, facing me, smiling to himself, then moving across the floor by popping up alternating heels, gliding in reverse, walking on the moon.

But the art form has a conspicuous symbolic significance in the artist\u2019s latest single, which Glover debuted on Saturday Night Live: The song\u2019s emphasis on dance was apparent in his live performance on the show, in the cover art for the track, and in the remarkable music video itself, which has more than 36 million views on YouTube as of publication. In the video, a grinning, shirtless Glover dances through a giant warehouse, occasionally accompanied by black school children in uniform, as chaotic scenes of violence unfold behind him\u2014and are sometimes enacted by him. Some researchers believe that the microbiome may play a role in regulating how people think and feel. By now, the idea that gut bacteria affect a person\u2019s health is not revolutionary. Many people know that these microbes influence digestion, allergies, and metabolism. The trend has become almost commonplace: New books appear regularly detailing precisely which diet will lead to optimum bacterial health. But these microbes\u2019 reach may extend much further, into the human brains. A growing group of researchers around the world are investigating how the microbiome, as this bacterial ecosystem is known, regulates how people think and feel. Scientists have found evidence that this assemblage\u2014about a thousand different species of bacteria, trillions of cells that together weigh between one and three pounds\u2014could play a crucial role in autism, anxiety, depression, and other disorders. The question is less whether a dress or an idea is borrowed, than the uses to which it\u2019s then put. Meet the Death Metal Cowboys of Botswana.

Question: Is this cultural appropriation? Why or why not? The question is inspired by a spasm of social-media cruelty that caught wide attention last week. A young woman in Utah bought a Chinese-style dress to wear to her high school formal. She posted some photographs of herself on her personal Instagram page\u2014and suddenly found herself the target of virulent online abuse. For once, the story has a happy ending. Good sense and kindness prevailed, and instead of her prom being ruined, the young woman exited the dance buoyed by worldwide support and affirmation, most of all from within China.

The talk-radio host\u2019s willingness to indulge the fantasy of a mob marching on D.C. to oust Robert Mueller can be called many things\u2014but not \u201cconservative.\u201d Talk radio\u2019s Rush Limbaugh delighted at the expansive twists and turns of the independent counsel investigation of Bill Clinton, cheering it all the way to impeachment, despite polls suggesting Americans wanted Congress to censure the president and move on. He met Barack Obama\u2019s election by declaring that he wanted him to fail, then allied with men who tried to discredit Obama by falsely stating he was born abroad. But now that the nation\u2019s leading birther, Donald Trump, is in the White House, Limbaugh purports to be outraged by what he calls efforts to undermine and unseat a duly elected president. In recent segments on his show, he has claimed that Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation is \u201cactually a cover-up for all of the things the Obama administration and the Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee engaged in to try to taint the election,\u201d and additionally, that \u201cif these people don\u2019t like the way you voted, they\u2019re gonna just throw it out. They\u2019re gonna do whatever they can to undermine it and sabotage it, \u2019cause they don\u2019t like the result.\u201d Marchers from last year\u2019s Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville who attacked a black counter-protester made a claim that has often worked for police officers: They acted in self-defense. The photographs of the beating show DeAndre Harris curled up in a ball on the floor of a parking lot trying to protect his face and body as the men around him, some armed with boards or pipes, strike him repeatedly. The men beating Harris were there to attend the white-nationalist rally in Charlottesville last August, where one counter-protester, Heather Heyer, was killed when a car drove into the crowd. Harris, who survived the beating with eight staples in his skull, might have been the second. To an uninformed observer, the picture may look like an image of mob violence. But to many of the men beating Harris and their attorneys, it shows something else: Men acting in self defense. \u201cTo be honest, I was terrified,\u201d Jacob Scott Goodwin, one of the men arrested for beating Harris told the jury during his trial. \u201cI\u2019d probably perish or be sent to the hospital and be terribly hurt.\u201d Seth Meyers on Saturday Night Live, Obama, Oprah 2020, and whether media elites try too hard to feel the pain of Trump voters In 2011, the comedian Seth Meyers, then the head writer for Saturday Night Live and host of the show\u2019s \u201cWeekend Update\u201d news roundup, mocked Donald Trump at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner. \u201cDonald Trump has been saying that he will run for president as a Republican,\u201d Meyers said, as Trump sat stone-faced in the audience, \u201cwhich is surprising, since I just assumed he was running as a joke.\u201d That same evening, President Barack Obama roasted Trump at length. The evening\u2019s jokes\u2014and the idea that they spurred Trump to run in 2016\u2014have become Washington lore. Meyers, who since 2014 has hosted Late Night on NBC, still refuses to pull any punches where Trump is concerned. In January, he hosted the Golden Globes and, in a clear callback to his 2011 mockery of Trump\u2019s presidential ambitions, winkingly berated Oprah Winfrey, telling her that she doesn\u2019t have what it takes to be president.

The nanostructured photoelectrode results in spontaneous hydrogen evolution from water without any external bias applied with a faradaic efficiency of 30% and excellent stability.\n The researchers believe this new type of photoelectrode is not only cheap to produce, but can also be recreated on a larger scale for mass and worldwide use.\nAn open-access paper on the work is published in Scientific Reports.\n A promising way of storing solar energy is via chemical fuels, in particular hydrogen as it is considered as a future energy carrier. The greatest challenge is to develop a suitable technology for large scale and cost effective solar fuel production to compete with fossil fuel. One way this could be achieved is by using photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting which directly converts water and sunlight to solar fuel (hydrogen).  \u2026 Cost effective solar fuel generation is hindered by the semiconductor material not meeting certain essential criteria to achieve highly efficient solar to hydrogen conversion. These criteria are as follows: (i) the visible part of the solar spectrum must be absorbed for higher efficiency of hydrogen production and the band edges should ideally straddle the redox potential of water splitting, (ii) the photoexcited carriers must separate and migrate to the surface without recombination, (iii) adsorbed species must be reduced and oxidized by the photogenerated electrons and holes to produce H2 and O2. Also for cost effective, environmental and scalability issues, earth abundant non-toxic materials should be the focus of research into new semiconductor materials. \u2026 To the best of our knowledge, we report for the first time the nanostructured LaFeO3 photoelectrode for spontaneous hydrogen evolution from water without any external applied bias. \nTo prepare the photoelectrode, the researchers sprayed precursor solution at 150\u2009\u00b0C and then annealed at different temperature from 475\u2009\u00b0C to 625\u2009\u00b0C with an increment of 25\u2009\u00b0C to get single phase crystalline LaFeO3 material. \n \nThe team analyzed the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of LaFeO3 in 0.1\u2009M aqueous NaOH (pH 13) solution by illuminating the photoelectrode from the electrolyte side. \n They found the annealing temperature was found to be an important factor which directly affected the photocurrent density of the LaFeO3 photoelectrodes.\n \nThe water splitting was conducted in a glass reactor vessel. The LaFeO3 working electrode and Pt counter electrode were connected by a single looped wire, without any external bias being applied. Hydrogen was produced spontaneously during the water splitting test during the first 6\u2009hour cycle where the photoelectrode generated 0.18 \u03bcmol\/cm2 of hydrogen after 6\u2009hours, with a faradaic efficiency of 30%. \n \nIt then underwent a second cycle of water splitting test to determine if the electrode was re-usable and how much the performance varied. After a further 6\u2009hours illumination, the LaFeO3 thin film generated 0.08 \u03bcmol\/cm2 of hydrogen (Figure S8). This provided additional evidence that the film is re-useable, although the amount of hydrogen produced is almost halved, the researchers said.\n These findings demonstrate that LaFeO3 is a potential candidate to act as a photoelectrode for unassisted PEC water splitting to generate solar fuel (hydrogen) cost effectively. However further work is required to investigate and improve slow charge carrier dynamics and low light absorption challenges of LaFeO3 photoelectrodes. Resources \nGovinder S. Pawar & Asif A.

Glassdoor hadn\u2019t raised new money in about two years, when it was valued by investors at around $860 million, so it likely needed to decide whether to raise more money, sell or try to go public. The company reportedly was at least considering an IPO in the second half of 2018 and was interviewing banks that could take them there. The deal, at a premium compared to that last price, is a long-anticipated win for venture investors who have waited as long as eleven years to take home some cash. Early investors have included Benchmark, Sutter Hill Ventures and Battery Ventures. In addition to job listings, Glassdoor also gives employees the chance to anonymously describe their experience at companies to prospective employees.

(NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced the first steps for integrating CoreOS Tectonic, Quay, and Container Linux with Red Hat\u2019s robust container and Kubernetes-based solutions portfolio. Container application platforms like Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform already provide CIOs with a powerful, open standards-based solution to fuel digital transformation efforts, helping enterprises more quickly adopt emerging technologies like Linux containers and Kubernetes without sacrificing existing applications or IT investments. CoreOS\u2019 technologies advance the comprehensive nature of Red Hat\u2019s container infrastructure offerings, providing a clear roadmap for the digital enterprise while simultaneously making hybrid cloud environments an excellent choice for deploying both modern and traditional applications. We strongly believe that the integration of CoreOS\u2019 automation technologies with Red Hat\u2019s powerful infrastructure solutions will redefine the hybrid cloud, meshing the simplicity of public cloud deployments with the enhanced security of private cloud computing. Acquired with CoreOS in January 2018, Tectonic and Container Linux will help drive automation at every layer of the cloud-native stack, backed by Red Hat\u2019s commitment to enterprise-grade stability and support. This automation will extend to Red Hat\u2019s robust independent software vendor (ISV) ecosystem, enabling them to more easily deliver and maintain applications and services on top of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform across hybrid environments with the simplicity of public clouds. OpenShift automated operations\nTectonic, CoreOS\u2019 enterprise Kubernetes solution, offered a powerful way to manage large Kubernetes footprints through automated \u201cover-the-air\u201d updates. With this feature, systems administrators and IT managers can more easily roll-out upgrades to entire Tectonic clusters and underlying Container Linux hosts all via an automated process. Now, Red Hat plans to integrate this capability with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, Red Hat\u2019s comprehensive enterprise-grade Kubernetes distribution, as automated operations. With automated operations, IT teams will be able to use the automated upgrades of Tectonic paired with the reliability, support, and extensive application development capabilities of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. This makes managing Kubernetes deployments at-scale easier, with the vast majority of rote maintenance tasks performed automatically, lessening the need for constant administrator action and providing a \u201clights out\u201d approach to cluster oversight. Other enterprise needs are retained through the addition of automated operations to Red Hat OpenShift as well, including platform stability and support for existing IT assets. The Operator Framework\nCoreOS also established the concept of \u201coperators\u201d within Kubernetes, application-specific controllers that extend the Kubernetes API to create, configure, and manage instances of complex stateful applications on behalf of a Kubernetes user. This effectively takes the \u201chuman knowledge\u201d of managing a Kubernetes application and builds it into software, making typically challenging workloads easier to deploy and maintain on Kubernetes. Announced at KubeCon Europe 2018, the Operator concept is now encapsulated by the Operator Framework open source project. Building on this initiative, Red Hat today announced that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform will use this project for the benefit of Red Hat\u2019s ISV ecosystem. This makes it easier for ISVs to bring cloud services, like messaging, big data, analytics, and more, to the hybrid cloud and address a broader set of enterprise deployment models while avoiding cloud lock-in. Red Hat also intends to extend its existing ISV certification program to encompass the automation capabilities provided by the Operator Framework. The result will be a consistent, common experience for these services on Red Hat OpenShift, enabling ISVs to bring their offerings to market more quickly on any cloud infrastructure where Red Hat OpenShift runs. Bringing Container Linux to Red Hat OpenShift\nContainer Linux provides several key pieces of the modern, container-native operating system, most notably a fully immutable, container-optimized Linux host that includes automated, \u201cover-the-air\u201d updates, to keep large deployments up to date more easily. Built around a robust existing community, Container Linux plans to \u00a0retain its vision of providing a free, fast-moving, and automated container host while also providing content options from the Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora ecosystem, with a supported variant being provided under the name Red Hat CoreOS. Red Hat CoreOS is expected to integrate concepts, technology, and the user experience of Container Linux. This offering is intended to ultimately supersede Atomic Host and function as Red Hat\u2019s immutable, container-centric operating system. Red Hat CoreOS is also expected to provide the foundation for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, Red Hat OpenShift Online, and Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated for customers who prefer an immutable infrastructure-based Kubernetes platform with automated updates. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform will also continue to support Red Hat Enterprise Linux, for customers who prefer a traditional lifecycle and packaging as the foundation for their Kubernetes deployments.  Red Hat Quay and OpenShift\nOver the past few years, many Red Hat OpenShift customers have used CoreOS Quay as their enterprise registry solution. While OpenShift provides an integrated container registry, customers who require more comprehensive enterprise grade registry capabilities now have the option to get Quay Enterprise and Quay.io from Red Hat. Quay includes automated geographic replication, integrated security scanning with Clair, image time machine for viewing history, performs rollbacks and automated pruning, and more. Quay is now added to the Red Hat portfolio, available both as an enterprise software solution and as a hosted service at Quay.io, and is expected to see future enhancements and continued integration with OpenShift in future releases. Availability\nTectonic\u2019s automated operations, Red Hat CoreOS and more are expected to be fully integrated into Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform in future versions. Container Linux is expected to \u00a0continue to be maintained while its successor will be developed with the Fedora and CoreOS Communities. Red Hat Quay is available immediately at https:\/\/quay.io\/. Press Conference\nRed Hat executives, including Paul Cormier, the company\u2019s president of Products and Technologies, will host a webcast live from Red Hat Summit to discuss this and today's other announcements at 2 p.m. ET. Following remarks, press and analysts are invited to participate in a question and answer session.

Previously, enterprises had to choose between public cloud lock-in for ease-of-use or managing the complexity of a hybrid IT environment to retain full control over workloads and data. Now, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform will be positioned to settle this argument, delivering automation across the entire container stack, from the underlying operating system to the application services, to make hybrid IT easier to consume while retaining enhanced security, driving a new model for how enterprises perceive the open hybrid cloud.\u201d Red Hat is the world's leading provider of open source software solutions, using a community-powered approach to provide reliable and high-performing cloud, Linux, middleware, storage and virtualization technologies.

It might not yet be obvious to many people how to install a PWA, but if you\u2019ve done it once you won\u2019t forget it and it\u2019s simpler than using an app store. There are many reasons to start building PWAs and converting current responsive web apps, including: You need 4 things to make a PWA: HTTPS hosting, a service worker, a properly configured index.html file, and a web app manifest.json file. The examples below are geared towards React but are similar for any framework. Firebase provides free SSL certificates and freemium hosting. Another great choice is Netlify. If you want your app to work offline once installed, you\u2019ll need a service worker. Create React App makes one for you, but you can always configure your own using something like this. Learn more about how they work. A challenge in configuring your app is understanding the difference in how iOS and Android use the meta tags in index.html and the web app manifest. We\u2019ll explain how each option is used below. One painful part to this process is creating the massive number of splash screens for iOS: one for each screen size and orientation you want to support, otherwise users will see a white screen while your app loads. Create React App makes a manifest.json file in your public directory, but if you don\u2019t have one yet create it and make sure it\u2019s referenced in index.html (lines 19\u201320 above). With a service worker, your app loads without a network connection, however it won\u2019t have much functionality. Enter Firebase. Firebase\u2019s brand new Cloud Firestore improves upon their Realtime Database with several enhancements but most notably it will continuously attempt to sync data while offline. To make sure users also *start* with data when they launch your PWA without a connection, use localStorage. Our sample React app combines these two methods to let you access tasks you\u2019ve already created and add new ones regardless of connection status. Much like responsive design, PWAs offer unique design options. Should something be styled differently when viewed as an installed PWA and when viewed on the same device but in a browser? Here are handy media queries for targeting installed PWAs: Similarly, to see how users are viewing your PWAs in JavaScript: By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

Three new resolutions to the Fermi Paradox. And how we could easily colonise the whole\u00a0universe. By Robert Wiblin \u00b7 Published May 8th, 2018 Enjoyed the episode? Want to listen later? Subscribe by searching \u201c80,000 Hours\u201d wherever you get your podcasts, or click one of the buttons below:  It seems tremendously wasteful to have stars shining. When you think about the sheer amount of energy they\u2019re releasing, that seems like it\u2019s a total waste. Except that it\u2019s about 0.5 percent of the mass energy that gets converted into light and heat. The rest is just getting into heavy nuclei. If you can convert mass into energy, you might actually not care too much about stopping stars. If the process of turning off stars is more costly than 0.5% of the total mass energy, then you will not be doing it.  Anders Sandberg The universe is so vast, yet we don\u2019t see any alien civilizations. If they exist, where are they? Oxford University\u2019s Anders Sandberg has an original answer: they\u2019re \u2018sleeping\u2019, and for a very compelling reason. Because of the thermodynamics of computation, the colder it gets, the more computations you can do. The universe is getting exponentially colder as it expands, and as the universe cools, one Joule of energy gets worth more and more. If they wait long enough this can become a 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000x gain. So, if a civilization wanted to maximize its ability to perform computations \u2013 its best option might be to lie in wait for trillions of years. Why would a civilization want to maximise the number of computations they can do? Because conscious minds are probably generated by computation, so doing twice as many computations is like living twice as long, in subjective time. Waiting will allow them to generate vastly more science, art, pleasure, or almost anything else they are likely to care about. But there\u2019s no point waking up to find another civilization has taken over and used up the universe\u2019s energy. So they\u2019ll need some sort of monitoring to protect their resources from potential competitors like us. It\u2019s plausible that this civilization would want to keep the universe\u2019s matter concentrated, so that each part would be in reach of the other parts, even after the universe\u2019s expansion. But that would mean changing the trajectory of galaxies during this dormant period. That we don\u2019t see anything like that makes it more likely that these aliens have local outposts throughout the universe, and we wouldn\u2019t notice them until we broke their rules. But breaking their rules might be our last action as a species. This \u2018aestivation hypothesis\u2019 is the invention of Dr Sandberg, a Senior Research Fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University, where he looks at low-probability, high-impact risks, predicting the capabilities of future technologies and very long-range futures for humanity. In this incredibly fun conversation we cover this and other possible explanations to the Fermi paradox, as well as questions like: The 80,000 Hours podcast is produced by Keiran Harris. The basic question that made us interested in the Fermi paradox in the first place is, does the silence of the sky foretell our doom? We really wonder if the evidence that the universe seems to be pretty devoid of intelligent life is a sign that our future is in danger, that there is some bad things ahead for us. One way of reasoning about this is the great filter idea from Robin Hanson. There has to be some step that is unlikely from going from inanimate matter to life, to intelligence, to some intelligence that makes a fuss that you can observe over astronomical distances. One of these probabilities of transition must be very, very low, otherwise the universe would be full of aliens making parking lots on the moon and putting up adverts on the Andromeda galaxy.  It would be very obvious if we lived in that kind of universe, so you can say, \u201cWell, it\u2019s obvious we\u2019re alone. The probability of life might be super low, or maybe it\u2019s that life is easy by intelligence is rare.\u201d In that case, we are lucky and we\u2019re fairly alone, which might be a bit sad, but it also means we\u2019re responsible for the rest of the universe and the silence in the sky doesn\u2019t actually say anything bad. The problem is, of course, that it also might be that intelligence is actually fairly common, but it doesn\u2019t survive; there is something very dangerous about being an intelligence species. You tend to wipe yourself out or become something inert. Maybe all civilizations quickly discover something World of Warcraft or other games and succumb to that. Or, some other, more subtle convergence threat. Except that many of these explanations of what that bad and dangerous thing is are very strange explanations. It\u2019s an interesting question when we know that certain boxes shouldn\u2019t be opened. Sometimes we can have a priori understandings, but this research field, whatever the effects it has tend to be local. So if we open that box and there were bad stuff, there is also going to be local disasters. That might be much more acceptable than some other fields where when you have effects, they tend to be global. If something bad exists in the box, it might affect an entire world. This is, for example, why I think we should be careful about technologies that produce something self-replicating. Whether that is computer viruses or biological organisms, or artificial intelligence that can copy themselves. Or maybe even memes and ideas that can spread from mind to mind. We want to avoid existential risk that could mean that we would never get this grand future. We might want to avoid doing stupid things that limit our future. We might want to avoid doing things that create enormous suffering of disvalue in these futures. So, what I\u2019ve been talking about here is kind of our understanding about how big the future is, and then that leads to questions like, \u201cWhat do we need to figure out right now to get it?\u201d Some things are obvious, like reducing existential risk. Making sure we survive and thrive. Making sure we have an open future. Some of it might be more subtle, like how do we coordinate once we start spreading out very far? Right now, we are within one seventh of a second away from each other. All humans are on the same planet or just above it. That\u2019s not going to be true forever. Eventually, we are going to be dispersed so much that you can\u2019t coordinate, and we might want to figure out some things that should be true for all our descendants.

I\u2019m Rob Wiblin, Director of Research at 80,000 Hours. My interview with Anders Sandberg was so entertaining I decided to split it into two episodes, which each cover pretty different themes. This is the first part and it\u2019s focussed on a range of possible solutions to the Fermi Paradox, and how the universe could actually end up being colonised. We go well beyond the usual introductions you may have heard before. If you enjoy the episode, please share it on social media and tell your friends they should subscribe to the show! Without further ado I bring you Anders Sandberg. Robert Wiblin: Today, I\u2019m speaking with Dr Anders Sandberg. Anders is a senior research fellow at the Oxford University\u2019s Future of Humanity Institute, where he looks at low-probability, high-impact risks, estimating the capabilities of future technologies and very long-range futures for humanity. Topics of particular interest include global catastrophic risks, cognitive biases, and cognitive enhancement. Anders has a background in computer science, neuroscience, and medical engineering, and he got his PhD in computational neuroscience at Stockholm University in Sweden for work on a neural network modeling of human memory. Thanks for coming on the podcast, Anders. Anders Sandberg: Thank you for having me here. Robert Wiblin: We\u2019re going to dive into a bunch of things you\u2019ve studied while at the Future of Humanity Institute, which range from being a bit out there to being extremely out there. But first, how do you decide what to research and work on? Anders Sandberg: Normally, I try to figure out what the most important thing I could be doing is, and I do that. Except, of course, that in practice, this is not how it works. So while I\u2019m trying to figure out what truly matters, in practice, I tend to go for the most interesting, shiny problem. But when I do constructive procrastination, I have ten projects going on at the same time. In order to work on one of them, I will work on some other projects, because I can\u2019t bring myself to do that. And then, of course, I get a bit frustrated with them, so I move to another one. I\u2019m working on a rather broad front with many things at the same time. This might not be the most effective way of working, but it certainly allows a lot of very interesting cross-fertilization. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. I think you\u2019re one of the people with the widest interests of almost anyone that I know, and the widest number of different strange things that you\u2019ve studied over the course of your career. And also, I guess, one of the happiest people, as well. Do you think that you\u2019re as cheerful as you seem to be? Anders Sandberg: I think so. It\u2019s of course very hard to judge your own subjective happiness, but I certainly feel very bubbly, which is actually not always a good thing, because I\u2019m also rather content with whatever situation there is. Yes, there are a lot of frustrations, but I can always say, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s not that bad.\u201d Sometimes, having a low dynamic range of your mood might be a bit troublesome. Robert Wiblin: Yeah, interesting. Do you think, on balance, we need people who are unhappy to be agitators to fix problems? Anders Sandberg: I think you need to have the right kind of mixture. On the one hand, being an optimist means that you have a lot of biases that will make you wrong about many things; you\u2019re still not going to be very sad when you find out you were wrong about your expectations. The pessimist, will of course, find himself right a lot of times, but will not become happier. But together, of course, the optimist and pessimist are actually a pretty good team. The optimist will try new things, will suggest that this can be done and try his or her hand at it; the pessimist will point out what\u2019s problematic, what can\u2019t be done. If you get the right dynamic, this is way more effective than having a single person. Of course, most of us have a mixture of optimist and pessimist in our head; we\u2019re switching between the different moods. But sometimes it\u2019s also useful to specialize. Robert Wiblin: It seems to me like people who are really depressed might be more aware of their problems, but also less motivated to solve them because they don\u2019t expect to succeed at doing so. But I guess there are some people who have a negative outlook but are extremely animated as a result of that, because they\u2019re frustrated by some injustice, so they really wanna ride it. While they have a negative outlook, they\u2019re not necessarily pessimistic about fixing things. Do you agree with that kind of distinction? Anders Sandberg: I do. Similarly, as an optimist, you can be a very complacent optimist, saying, \u201cOh, everything is just getting better. I\u2019m just gonna wait until the singularity arrives and everything will be fine,\u201d or a dynamic optimist saying, \u201cOh, the future could be wonderful. It really looks promising. We need to safeguard it and do things to get there.\u201d Maybe because you just want to get there as quickly as possible, but also it might be because you realize that there is various problems that need to be solved before we get to the glorious future. Robert Wiblin: Listeners might very well have picked up that you\u2019re Swedish. Nick Bostrom is Swedish as well, right? Anders Sandberg: Oh, yeah. Robert Wiblin: The founder of the Future of Humanity Institute. Are there any other Swedes at FHI, or is it just you two? Anders Sandberg: Not strictly speaking right now, but we certainly have Swedes that have been visiting. There are people in the building and working effective altruists that are from Sweden, and there is a shocking number of Swedes interested in our kind of questions. Max Tegmark might be the most famous one. It\u2019s interesting, because there\u2019s a lot of Swedes, but most of them are not in Sweden. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. Why do you think so many Swedes are involved? Did you know Bostrom before you came to FHI, or is that just a coincidence? Anders Sandberg: I knew him before. We had been emailing and interacting in the world of transhumanists. Then he pointed out that he had started an institute and was recruiting people, and I managed to get the job. I think we didn\u2019t have that strong links. It was mostly a coincidence that we happened to be Swedes. I think the deeper root of the ubiquity of Swedes, because, let\u2019s face it, Sweden is not a large country, it\u2019s ten million people, is that it has good education, a fairly consequentialist mindset. Playing the trolley problem game with my niece and nephew was very amusing, because it turns out that even small children immediately get this idea about maximizing the number of saved persons. Except, of course, my youngest nephew, who tried to maximize the number of people run over. But maximizing is important to Swedes. That, of course, leads to a particular mindset. But the problem in Sweden is that being entrepreneurial, changing the rules, that\u2019s not really done. If you like doing that, then you can seek your fortune outside. Robert Wiblin: Interesting. You get the education necessary to change things, but then if you actually wanna do it, you have to come to Oxford. I guess there\u2019s a slightly similar phenomenon with Australians. Most listeners will know that I\u2019m Australian; they\u2019ll be able to tell that pretty fast. There\u2019s a lot of Australians involved in effective altruism, but most of them aren\u2019t in Australia. I wonder whether it\u2019s because people are more willing to leave Australia to pursue their fortune and their career than people are willing to leave the UK or the United States. Anders Sandberg: That could be another reason, just that feeling that, \u201cOkay, there is an outside world and it\u2019s okay to go out there and explore.\u201d Robert Wiblin: Yeah. I guess if you\u2019re an Australian, Australia feels quite isolated. It is very small. it\u2019s only 20 million people. A bit bigger than Sweden, but not that much. Just so many of my friends have gone overseas, but those who are really ambitious about pursuing their career are almost all considering leaving at some point. Anders Sandberg: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Robert Wiblin: Let\u2019s dive into a couple of the papers that you have published over the last few years. I\u2019ve been looking at your page on the Future of Humanity Institute\u2019s website. I\u2019ll stick up links to all of the things that we discuss here. The first and perhaps most remarkable, is you and Toby Ord recently published a paper where you claimed to basically have dissolved the Fermi paradox, which is a paradox that a lot of listeners will have heard of. What\u2019s the story there? Anders Sandberg: Well, the basic question that made us interested in the Fermi paradox in the first place is, does the silence of the sky foretell our doom? We really wonder if the evidence that the universe seems to be pretty devoid of intelligent life is a sign that our future is in danger, that there is some bad things ahead for us. One way of reasoning about this is the great filter idea from Robin Hanson. There has to be some step that is unlikely from going from inanimate matter to life, to intelligence, to some intelligence that makes a fuss that you can observe over astronomical distances. One of these probabilities of transition must be very, very low, otherwise the universe would be full of aliens making parking lots on the moon and putting up adverts on the Andromeda galaxy. Robert Wiblin: It would be like Rick and Morty. Anders Sandberg: Exactly. It would be very obvious if we lived in that kind of universe, so you can say, \u201cWell, it\u2019s obvious we\u2019re alone. The probability of life might be super low, or maybe it\u2019s that life is easy by intelligence is rare.\u201d In that case, we are lucky and we\u2019re fairly alone, which might be a bit sad, but it also means we\u2019re responsible for the rest of the universe and the silence in the sky doesn\u2019t actually say anything bad. The problem is, of course, that it also might be that intelligence is actually fairly common, but it doesn\u2019t survive; there is something very dangerous about being an intelligence species. You tend to wipe yourself out or become something inert. Maybe all civilizations quickly discover something World of Warcraft or other games and succumb to that. Or, some other, more subtle convergence threat. Except that many of these explanations of what that bad and dangerous thing is are very strange explanations. So we started thinking about the Fermi paradox and we tried to see, did people do some assumption here that was wrong or weird. When you start thinking about the Fermi paradox, basically what you do is something like the Drake equation. You say, \u201cThe universe is really, really big. There is a lot of sites wherein life and intelligence could have emerged, and a lot of time for them to do that.\u201d Then you multiply that with some probability of intelligence, of a technological civilization emerge. Typically people then say, \u201cYeah, you have a very big number, you multiply with a small number.\u201d But that first number is so literally astronomically big that you ought to get a lot of civilizations. We don\u2019t see them, and that\u2019s weird. Robert Wiblin: What is, roughly, the number of stars, say, in the observable universe? Anders Sandberg: We have about 300 billion stars in the Milky Way alone, and then you have, in the observable universe, many hundreds of billions of galaxies. We\u2019re literally talking about Carl Sagan level of billions of billions, and \u2026 Robert Wiblin: So, it\u2019s what, ten to the 20? Anders Sandberg: Something like that. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. Okay. It\u2019s a very large number, but we don\u2019t see any life out there. If you had an intergalactic civilization, you might be able to observe them, for example, blocking out the light coming from stars, because they would be using it as an enormous solar power plant, and you\u2019d see all of this mass, all of these stars out there, but you couldn\u2019t see the light coming from them. We might have a shot at picking up if there was life even very far away, but we don\u2019t see that. Anders Sandberg: Yeah. There has been an interesting survey called [jay hat 00:09:56] that actually looked at different galaxies and their energy emissions, and tried to see are there any galaxies that look like something is absorbing a lot of energy? While they found some peculiar galaxies, nothing really seemed to fit the bill. We know that, at least, out of the 500,000 galaxies they watched, none of them had this kind of super civilization. Robert Wiblin: Okay, we\u2019re trying to explain how is that? What\u2019s the problem that people find, why is this been something that people have been scratching their heads about for 60, 70 years? Anders Sandberg: Our answer is people have been looking at point estimates and not taking uncertainty into account in the right way. At this point many people in the field would protest and say, \u201cHey, we really know what we are uncertain. You are really being unfair to us.\u201d If I caricature the typical argument people give, it\u2019s something like they discuss the different factors and say, \u201cYeah, that one has roughly this value. The probability of life, we don\u2019t know but maybe we can make a guess. A very uncertain guess and one in a million, or one in a hundred.\u201d Then you get to the end of a calculation and then you have a number and you say, \u201cWell this is, of course, based on my guesstimates and many of them are really uncertain. This number should be taken with an enormous pinch of salt.\u201d However, it ends up in the ballpark of something. There is an internal joke in the SETI community that we in the two schools. One school that tends to think that, \u201cYeah, there should be thousands or millions of civilizations in the milky way so we should expect to be able to communicate with galactic club.\u201d The other ones that think that, \u201cNo, our calculation ends up with roughly one and that\u2019s us, so we\u2019re alone in the milky way.\u201d Now, what went wrong in this calculation? Well, the handling of uncertainty was actually bad. When I\u2019m claiming that I\u2019m a bit uncertain of how many inhabitants live in the great London region, that doesn\u2019t mean that if I say 10 million and I\u2019m uncertain about it, that, that was a good estimate. I could say, \u201cI have a confidence interval between one million and 30 million.\u201d Now, I\u2019m very confident that the true value is somewhere in there and then I can do other calculations where I make use of its confidence intervals. As I learn more, these intervals get smaller. For example, the number of stars in the milky way, we are somewhat uncertain about it but we cannot do a lot of observations and that number will converge rather nicely. We\u2019re really uncertain about the probability of life emerging on earth-like planet. I will get back to that a bit later. The thing is, you want to multiply together these uncertainties and end up with a distribution of uncertainty rather than a number because if you just take individual numbers with a point estimate, you will typically get an impression that you have a central value. A typical value that\u2019s very different from what the distribution actually will have. Robert Wiblin: Does the problem appear when you\u2019re multiplying many different things that you\u2019re uncertain about together? Anders Sandberg: Yes. This is a generic problem. Another reason we\u2019re interested in this is that it applies not just to the question of alien life, but also thinking about risk. For example, if you\u2019re designing a bio lab and you want to know what\u2019s the probability of lab accident causing a pandemic? You can make similar kind of calculation. You can say, \u201cWell, what\u2019s the probability that we\u2019re working on a real pathogenic virus times the probability that we have someone drops a test tube, times the probability of somebody actually contracting that disease and getting outside the lab and spreading it?\u201d You multiply together to get uncertain things. Some of these ones you have a pretty decent idea about, some of them are just guess work. Together, you get some probability distribution and that can give you a very different answer. If you go back to the alien example, imagine that we have nine factors and they could be between zero and 0.2. If we just take the medium values, 0.1 and multiply them together it would say, \u201cIt\u2019s one chance in a billion with the 300 billion stars in the milky way, which would expect 300 civilizations.\u201d The probability seems to be very much against us being all alone. If you do it more carefully, if you actually multiply together these confidence intervals and the math, of course, gets slightly more messy. Which, is one reason people don\u2019t like doing it, you get the distribution but actually gives us a very high probability to be alone in the galaxy because it could turn out that some of these uncertain permits actually have fairly low values. This is what has gone wrong in a lot of these na\u00efve applications. Now, serious researchers will say, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m not that stupid. I\u2019m actually thinking carefully about it.\u201d There is a surprising amount of thinking that is strongly predicated on these point estimates. Now, when you try to do it right you actually find that you get a tail of low probability that is very hard to avoid. Even if we take all the papers people have been publishing about alien life that have the estimates for these parameters for the drake equation. They are, of course, all written by optimists who like writing about our chances of contacting alien life rather than pessimists who think this is all a waste of time. Then you just randomly re-sample them. You make a made up distribution of what people said in the literature. You end up with about 8% chance that we\u2019re alone in the visible universe. This is just based on the optimist papers. You end up with about, I think, 20 to 30% chance that we\u2019re alone in the milky way. Again, based on these optimistic papers. If you then try to make the estimates of a real uncertainty based on current science based on some of its parameters better, you get even [inaudible 00:15:24] uncertainties. We have, essentially, a hundred orders of magnitude uncertain about how likely life is to emerge on plants. It could be that spontaneous generation of life is natural. As soon as you have a puddle with the right organic stuff, it will attempt to form. We can\u2019t rule that out. On the other hand it might be that it actually does almost take a thermodynamic miracle. Similarly, whether that life can evolve to intelligence, there are other good reasons to be really uncertain about whether you can get advanced complex life. It could be that life is super common in the universe but most of it is very simple bacteria that have genetic coding systems that are very simple to evolve but are then very rigid so you can\u2019t evolve much more. We happen to have one that might have just the right level of complexity. This uncertainty when you put that in. Now you get a much, much bigger range. It\u2019s interesting because this whole model. This is all armchair astrobiology. We haven\u2019t left the room. We\u2019re just reading scientific papers and making estimates. Still can be very optimistic. You can\u2019t say that the main number of civilizations we make might be in the hundreds but you can\u2019t avoid getting this tail suggestion that actually some pretty high likelihood that we\u2019re alone. Now, this leads to an interesting conclusion that an empty sky is not that surprising. We shouldn\u2019t be shocked. It\u2019s not much of a paradox, it\u2019s just an observation. Robert Wiblin: When you consider the fact that you can\u2019t rule out the possibility that some of these factors that go into the drake equation, like how often does life spontaneously appear from non-life or how often does intelligence evolve from bacteria. You can\u2019t rule out the fact that some of these factors might be basically zero. Like extremely close to zero and as a result it\u2019s not that surprising if the number of expected intelligent life in the universe is less than one. Even if you\u2019re saying the average number of instances of intelligent intergalactic civilization that we expect might be 100 or 1,000 or 10,000 it could also be very easily one or zero. Anders Sandberg: Yes, exactly. Robert Wiblin: I guess we look up at the sky and we can see that it\u2019s probably not 10,000, it\u2019s probably not 100,000, or we would be observing some of them. Now, we have quite a bit of evidence to say, \u201cWell, before we thought the probability of us being alone in the universe was 10% and now when we look up in the sky maybe it\u2019s 30, or 40, or 50%.\u201d Anders Sandberg: That\u2019s also true and that also leads to the really good news that comes out of all this mathematical treatment. The first half showing that the Fermi paradox isn\u2019t terribly paradoxical. That\u2019s kind of nice. When we actually look outside of the library we see that there are no UFO\u2019s miss-parked on the street below. We haven\u2019t seen any super civilization in nearby galaxies. There doesn\u2019t seem to be too many crashed alien spacecraft on the moon and so on. That gives us an update that rules out the Rick and Morty universe full of aliens. It\u2019s a very weak update. We haven\u2019t been observing that long. We haven\u2019t been observing that careful, but we can say, \u201cYeah, there can\u2019t be more than the one civilization per solar system,\u201d at the very least. You cut off that extreme tail. Now you can do the math and go back and see how does that update parameters going in? The interesting part here was the least uncertain parameters don\u2019t change very much. The rate of star formation of a number of stars in the milky way don\u2019t get changed by the fact that I don\u2019t see a UFO parked on the street outside. Which is as it should be, otherwise our theory would be rather crazy. However, the really uncertain parameters get affected a lot. Now, which are the really uncertain parameters? Well that seems to be a probability of getting life and the probability of life having the capacity to evolve into an intelligence. Here, we have hundreds of orders of magnitude of uncertainty. They moves several order of magnitude and size just by this very weak observation that there are no really nearby aliens. Now, the drake equation also has that famous or infamous last term that the lifespan of a civilization. The average time a civilization remains able to communicate. That\u2019s, of course, the real reason we care about this. We want to know our own future. It\u2019s very uncertain. We know that it must be more than a few decades because we have survived that long. We don\u2019t seem to be super lucky. It had to be less than 10 billion years because otherwise the drake equation doesn\u2019t function. It\u2019s build on assumption instead of the state universe and there is some technical equivalents here. That means we have about seven orders of magnitude of uncertainty. That\u2019s much less than the uncertainty about life. Our observation that we don\u2019t seem to be living in this Star Wars or Rick and Morty universe full of aliens means that we become slightly more pessimistic about the life spans of civilisations but not that much. But we move a lot of things about the probability of life. Now getting back to that thinking about the Great Filter. This suggests that the Great Filter is an early one. But the reason we don\u2019t see a lot of the universe inhabited by intelligence is that intelligence is actually rare rather than it will be wiped out by something scary. Robert Wiblin: So we observe that there\u2019s not much life in the universe as far as we can tell. And we\u2019re worried is the thing that causes that to be the case, risks that we face going forward from where we are now, or is it risks that we\u2019ve already managed to cross in the past like the development of intelligence or industrial mechanization, that kind of thing. And you\u2019re saying we should mostly update in favor of it having been a filter that we\u2019ve already passed rather than a filter that we haven\u2019t yet passed? Anders Sandberg: Yes. Robert Wiblin: Why is that? Anders Sandberg: So this has to do with where the uncertainties \u2026 And we have so much uncertainty about life and intelligence. So you can imagine this whole argument that\u2019s a series of springs of different stiffness that you put together and you stretch or compress. The springs that are the most floppy will move the most, while the stiff ones, the ones we are most certain about, will not change much. So this is a statistical argument for why the Great Filter is early and why the stars are not foretelling. You might say, \u201cOkay. This is all statistics. This actually doesn\u2019t give us that much actionable information.\u201d And that\u2019s true. This is still very much based on a logical mathematical reasoning about it. But it seems to be a new way of going about it. Actually applying Bayesian thinking to these certain existential questions. And of course, if we discover life, or if we discover something about how likely life is to emerge, we learn important things, which are much more powerful than my argument. Evidence will always beat any amount of whiteboard calculations. Robert Wiblin: Is that true? I mean, sometimes theoretical calculations can be very compelling. Anders Sandberg: I think theoretical calculations have a lot of strength. The problem is, you need to do them really right. When the calculation actually is totally correct, it has the entire force of the world of logic behind it, that\u2019s a titanic force that can really drive enormously long shades of reasoning very well. The problem is when you are standing there at the whiteboard with your pen, you\u2019re likely to make mistakes. You might overlook possibilities. The probability of a human doing the right action in a situation is typically less than 99%, even for the simplest operations. So now if you have a long argument, the probability of there being some slight error somewhere is almost 1. So this means that even though I might have a compelling argument that is rhetorically powerful and seems that every step has good logic, there might be flaws in it. If it\u2019s a very short one, the risk is of course smaller. So this is why I\u2019m always a bit skeptical about theoretical arguments when they come alone. You want to have several independent arguments that overlap and show the same conclusion. So if one of them is broken, you can still be fairly certain that the probability of the next one being broken is not very big. Robert Wiblin: Yeah, that\u2019s a really interesting way of putting it. I suppose it is my experience that sometimes I\u2019ll have a lot of reasoning that I just feel extremely confident about internally, but then when someone else checks it, or when I actually write it out clearly, I realize that I\u2019m wrong. And that happens all the time. And I also think in general that humans are not so great at reasoning. We have like systematic blind spots, potentially, where arguments can seem compelling, when in fact they\u2019re not because there\u2019s like some something that we\u2019re not very good at thinking about. For example, with this Fermi paper. You can imagine another civilization where they\u2019re very good at thinking about ranges of uncertainty, and that\u2019s always how they do it, and they appreciate this fact that taking point estimates, like they instinctively understand that taking point estimates creates a distorted picture once you multiply things together. But to humans that\u2019s not nearly so obvious. And so we can go about having long discussions that are all based on this misconception at the core of how we\u2019re trying to analyze the problem. Anders Sandberg: Yeah. And this is a really interesting problem in dealing with low probability high impact risks. So I have a paper that I\u2019m pretty happy with, together with Toby Ord a few years back, where we looked at the debate surrounding the large Hadron Collider. People were concerned that maybe it could create black holes or strange vats of vacuum decay that could destroy the world. And eventually we physicists were annoyed enough by lawsuits and other things to actually write a few papers trying to show that this was totally safe. The problem here is of course how certain can you be about an argument about safety when we\u2019re talking about something that is on the cutting edge of physics. Some of the arguments physicists gave were really nice. Like, Earth has been hit by cosmic rays for billions of years, so given that we should expect our little activity to be much less likely to cause anything harmful, and we\u2019re still here, so hence nothing bad could have happened. When you think about that argument, it might be compelling, but you also realize that if Earth had been destroyed, we wouldn\u2019t be around, so you have an observer selection effect. So you can quickly patch for it by saying, \u201cYeah, look at the moon. If the moon had been destroyed, we would still be here, and we would be noting a global strange math or a black hole orbiting us, and we would know something. But the moon is shining, everything is fine.\u201d The problem is, you need to patch for argument in quite a lot of ways, and now it becomes a fairly complex argument. So ideally, in order to prove that your understanding of the risk is really good, you want independent arguments. You want a cosmic ray argument. You want other statistical arguments about, for example, supernovas and other process in the universe that are based on other lines of reasoning. And together, even if each of our arguments is fallible and might be, just have a 1% chance of being wrong, if you have 20 of them, now you can be very certain that, yeah, there is no problem here. This is of course very, very different from how we normally like doing arguments in academe and all. We want a beautiful argument. We want a very compelling elegant line of reasoning and nothing else on the page. Having 20 different arguments, some of them really awkward, some of them really messy, some of them are using totally empirical stuff, that\u2019s not how you get your paper or book published. It doesn\u2019t look good. But it\u2019s much more robust. It\u2019s something you can trust. And so this is also how we should probably try to deal with the most problematic risks. We want to have independent groups evaluate them. Robert Wiblin: Just to explain why this mattered so much in the case of the Hadron Collider \u2026 Imagine, the scientists who were saying that it\u2019s definitely safe or that there\u2019s only a 1 in like a billion billion billion chance of it destroying us. Basically, that is correct if their analysis is correct. So if their analysis is correct, the probability is zero, basically. But what are the chances that their analysis is correct? Would that be 99% confidence that it\u2019s correct? That\u2019s almost certainly far too high, given all the reasons that you\u2019ve given, but even if there\u2019s a 1% chance that it\u2019s false, and in that case we don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s dangerous, we don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s unprecedented or not, that 1% times by whatever the likelihood is in that case, is gonna be much higher than 1 in a billion billion billion, which is the probability if their analysis is right. So basically, in a case where your analysis says that a risk is extremely unlikely, almost all of the risk arises in the case where your analysis has been wrong, which might actually be quite likely. Anders Sandberg: Exactly. And we see this outside the physics and existential risk. A classic example is finance. Long-Term Capital Management estimated that the risk of them going bankrupt, that would be a ten sigma event. It would essentially never happen in the history of the universe. A few months later, they went bankrupt, because their model was wrong. When our models of reality are wrong, we can\u2019t use them to make an accurate assessment of a risk. This is something I\u2019ve been actually working with in an industry collaboration with the reinsurance industry, because they\u2019re a bit worried about their catastrophe models. They are not perfect, and they\u2019re very aware of that, but we\u2019re also, the same models more or less that everybody else are using. So all the companies are making decisions that are correlated. So if the models are really badly wrong about something, it might mean that an entire industry will be mis-pricing or taking risks we shouldn\u2019t take on a global scale. So we have been working with to try to figure out ways around this systemic risk. Robert Wiblin: Mm. I guess another example of this that occurs to me is the Future of Humanity Institute has looked at the likelihood of a pandemic causing human extinction, killing everyone. And my understanding is that your conclusion was that it\u2019s reasonably likely that a pandemic could kill a lot of people, could kill a billion people, possibly even six billion people. But the probability of a pandemic killing all humans is extremely low, because it\u2019s just so hard for a disease to spread to everyone. And also for no one to have resistance to it naturally. Is that right? Anders Sandberg: Yup, yup. Robert Wiblin: But of course, you\u2019ve gotta worry about this issue here. So the probability of human extinction caused by a pandemic is very low if your analysis is correct. But this is a very messy analysis that\u2019s just based on part of your judgment, your understanding of what is possible with viruses and what is not, and you\u2019re not sure about that at all. So in fact, most of the risk now probably comes down to the scenario in which it turns out that you had a deep misunderstanding about this problem, and your analysis was severely flawed. Anders Sandberg: Exactly. And the interesting problem here is that it can be flawed in two directions. It could be that we\u2019re too pessimistic. Actually, there might be an upper limit of pandemic size, which is just a few hundred million people. In that case, the error doesn\u2019t do much harm. Robert Wiblin: It just goes to zero again. Anders Sandberg: Yeah. But if our error is that actually there is some way pandemics that, when they get really large, have extra bad effects. In that case of course, that uncertainty, means that we badly underestimate risk. And generally when dealing with risk, the conservative thing is to assume that the risk is bigger than your result. If you have an argument that the risk is absolutely zero, then it better be an extremely strong argument, and typically you can never make it that strong. Robert Wiblin: So again, in the case of the large Hadron Collider, I recall that, even though you thought people were overestimating how safe it was, you weren\u2019t against using it, because you thought the likelihood of the research from the large Hadron Collider preventing human extinction, was in fact higher than the risk of using it, causing human extinction. Is that right? Anders Sandberg: Yeah. I basically agree with most of the safety arguments, it\u2019s just that the methodology was a bit flawed. If we imagine people building Hadron Collider 2 plus, well, in that case we should do it in a different way, if they were to listen to me. But on the other hand, even some small risks are worth taking because they might actually help us understand the world better and make us survive much better in the world. Now, that trade-off is sometimes rather tricky. So, in the case of pandemics, we have this issue of gain of function research where people are actually in the lab making pandemic influenzas, and that has caused a lot of concern that might lead to lab accidents and releasing a pandemic. The reason people do this research is, of course, they want to prevent pandemics. So, in some sense, if you do it in the right way, you do something risky in order to reduce risk much more. The battle over the gain of function world is of course, is this research actually doing something useful? Now, when it comes to understanding physics, it\u2019s an interesting question. How much has that changed our overall existential risk and how much does that improve our future? Robert Wiblin: I guess you could argue the discovery of nuclear technology, the ability to split the atom, increased the risk. So maybe we don\u2019t want more fundamental research and physics. Maybe we just want to keep Pandora\u2019s Box closed. Anders Sandberg: And it\u2019s an interesting question when we know that certain boxes shouldn\u2019t be opened. Sometimes we can have a priori understandings, but this research field, whatever the effects it has tend to be local. So if we open that box and there were bad stuff, there is also going to be local disasters. That might be much more acceptable than some other fields where when you have effects, they tend to be global. If something bad exists in the box, it might affect an entire world. This is, for example, why I think we should be careful about technologies that produce something self-replicating. Whether that is computer viruses or biological organisms, or artificial intelligence that can copy themselves. Or maybe even memes and ideas that can spread from mind to mind. That self-replication factor is a hint that this needs much more care than something that just sits there, and might maybe blow up locally. So, when it comes to physics, was it a good thing that we discovered nuclear physics? I think maybe the world would have been better if Becquerel had put his piece of pitchblende in the wrong drawer. Now, he put it on photographic plate and he noticed that he got this weird shading because of some unknown radiation for pitchblende, and that led to the whole development of nuclear physics. Imagine the other world where he put the rock in a different drawer. In that drawer you might have still gotten quantum mechanics, because that was already a big problem among physicists at that time. They would not know anything about atomic nuclear or anything like that, but they would be very happy to deal with electrons. They would perhaps discover quantum mechanics, and a lot of important fundamental physics, including perhaps semiconductors and the things that are useful for computers. But we would get the nuclear and the weapons, and nuclear power much later. That might indeed have been a safer and better world. The problem was we couldn\u2019t make this decision. It\u2019s not like you could advise Becquerel should you put that rock in the drawer with the photographic film or not? That was a pure serendipity. You couldn\u2019t advise Marie Curie that her research was risky, unless you knew yourself about all the consequences. It was just basic chemistry, trying to understand what was going on. The point where it\u2019s obvious that nuclear power is actually something powerful and dangerous happens about the time Leo Szilard started to come up with chain reaction ideas. By that point it\u2019s kind of totally too late, because a lot of other people were thinking about it. So we can\u2019t control that very much. We can control the kind of experiments we do, and we can certainly try to find safe-making technologies earlier than the risky ones. I think this is also linked to an important concept, the technology completion conjecture. But in the long-run, every technology more or less that can be done, somebody will do. Even if it\u2019s an obviously stupid idea, somebody will be that guy. Sometimes it might take an extremely long time, but sooner or later somebody\u2019s just going to do it as an art project, or something. Robert Wiblin: Unless you have some strong central control to prevent that. Anders Sandberg: Yeah, but \u2026 Robert Wiblin: But setting that aside. Anders Sandberg: Yeah, well I think it\u2019s an interesting challenge, because the obvious thing is say let\u2019s ban the bad activities, let\u2019s try to impose the right kind of central control. But central control for technology and science has rarely worked very well. Part of it is that if a technology or a form of understanding is really interesting and appealing to people, they will get it, even if it\u2019s illegal. Another problem is that, as I\u2019ve been saying, we can\u2019t predict very well what new ideas arrive. That attempt to control practical technologies have been a very mixed bag. Some technologies have been very limited because of various taxation rules. It\u2019s definitely possible to harm the development of technology by setting rules in the wrong way. But attempts at banning printing in the west has totally failed, although it somewhat worked in Turkey. China banned travel overseas, which limited its naval power over a long time. The interesting thing is we can speed up beneficial technologies. Quite often we can figure out that biotechnology is going to allow us to make organisms with new properties, maybe we need a good way of mopping up organisms with new properties if we accidentally left them out of the lab. Or if, once we released the gene drive in the wild, we have second thoughts. We don\u2019t really know how to fix that yet, but we can imagine that there should be technology that can fix it, and we should put in effort to discover that before we release the gene drive or the GMOs. Similarly, when it comes to artificial intelligence there are good arguments why powerful artificial intelligence is dangerous and hard to control, so we should figure out ways of controlling it and aligning its values earlier. Before we have really powerful AI. So I\u2019m very much fond of what I call differential technology development. Think about the potential risks and downsides, and then try to come up with technologies or other fixes. They don\u2019t necessarily have to be a matter of a device, they could be a practice, or a tax, or something else, and get that done before. It\u2019s much more positive too than trying to ban something. People really hate when you prevent them from doing something they want. But people love it when you announce a price for coming up with a better way of safeguarding the ozone layer, or making geoengineering safer. People really like your idea, but we should come up with a better way of making AI safer. Robert Wiblin: Let\u2019s step back to the Fermi paradox. The core error in people analysis was using these point estimates and multiplying them together. Can you think of any other examples where people do this and it\u2019s leading them astray? Anders Sandberg: I think it\u2019s fairly common we do this in most risk estimates and security estimates. If you think about these classic calculations about reliability of a nuclear power plant, typically you can imagine a chain of events that lead to a disaster. Most of these steps seem to be fairly unlikely. So you multiply them together and get a really low probability and then you say, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s just one chance in a million.\u201d You\u2019re of course not certain about these steps, how likely they actually are. Especially after a few years when the engineers think they know what we\u2019re doing, and people are being sloppy, and the contractor have been replacing the pipe with something else. These probabilities become much fussier. Now we actually should assume, when you try to build the plant, that actually my probability estimate is uncertain, and I actually need to take this into account. I\u2019m going to get this tail event. And sometimes of course bad luck just happens in a very weird, correlated fashion. So there is this concept of normal accidents, because things become linked to each other. When you have a really complex system, things start becoming correlated in ways that you couldn\u2019t expect when you designed it. That also means that the risk of something going wrong suddenly goes way up. Robert Wiblin: Listeners, take this away as a general rule. If you find yourself trying to estimate something that\u2019s improbable, and you find yourself multiplying different parameters together, and you\u2019re not sure about them, then that\u2019s going to give you a misleading estimate. There\u2019s actually a website where you can try to correct for this called Guesstimate. Have you used that Anders? Anders Sandberg: Oh yeah, it\u2019s beautiful. Robert Wiblin: So I\u2019ll put up a link to that, and you should definitely get familiar with it, because we\u2019ve been using it at 80,000 Hours to try to deal with some of these issues. I think as the problem is more severe, the more unlikely is the event, and the more things you\u2019re multiplying together, and the more uncertain is each of those parameters, right? Anders Sandberg: Yeah. To some extent also modeling it is useful, because it gives you a sense of where your uncertainties are. Not just about values, but also about what\u2019s the structure of the problem, what could go wrong. So one interesting example, is about earthquake insurance in America. So there is this debate about whether there is fault zone under New Madrid in the Mississippi Valley. So there was a really big earthquake a long time ago, haven\u2019t been much ever since. So some people think that oh yeah, that is actually a fault zone, but occasionally has very bad events. Other say no, we don\u2019t think so. The way the insurance world in their earthquake models are modeling this is making a mixture model between earthquakes going on without the fault zone, and the world where that fault zone exists. We don\u2019t know which world they happen to be in, but they want insurance that makes sense in both of these worlds, so you mix them together. So in this case you have a relatively nice either\/or chance. In some cases you get even weirder anti-correlated risks. So if you\u2019re really worried about one possibility, then that actually rules out another bad possibility. So you need something more elaborate, and actually thinking about this, having others critique your thinking makes it so much more robust. Robert Wiblin: Let\u2019s move on to another solution that you suggested to the Fermi Paradox, which is the Aestivation Hypothesis. I\u2019d never heard of this word, aestivation? Is that it? Anders Sandberg: Yeah. Robert Wiblin: It means hibernation, right? Anders Sandberg: It\u2019s the exact opposite of hibernation, but means roughly the same thing. So, hibernation, that\u2019s when you\u2019re sleeping through winter. Aestivation is when you sleep through summer. Robert Wiblin: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Anders Sandberg: From the Latin for summer, aestas. So the idea here is that maybe there is advanced civilizations in the universe, but they\u2019re all sleeping. Robert Wiblin: So we\u2019re in summer now in the universe, because the stars are shining. Why would the aliens be hibernating? Anders Sandberg: It has to do with the thermodynamic cost of doing computation. When you do a computation, you\u2019re essentially moving information around. Well that means that you want to make changes that matter over time, and that has a cost. You\u2019re essentially reducing entropy when you do a calculation. For example, if you have a register in your computer and you erase what was there previously, now you reduced the entropy because now you\u2019re certain about the result. The laws of thermodynamic tell you that, \u201cYep, you can\u2019t, on average, reduce entropy. You need to pay for it.\u201d So somewhere, there\u2019s going to be a big waste heap coming out of your computer, and this is obviously true for our current computer because they run rather warm. But this is built into the laws of physics. This is something even the most perfect computer can\u2019t avoid. You basically need to pay a cost proportion to the number of bits of information you erase in your computation times the temperature. So now you will immediately say, \u201cLet\u2019s cool down the computer and run it therein at a very cold temperature. That\u2019s going to fix things.\u201d And if you\u2019re really sophisticated, you can start talking about frontal computers and reversible computing that can get around this in a softer way. But the most important part is error correction. Occasionally bits will just flip because of the radiation or randomness. You need to correct that, and that always has this energy cost. So your computations, they cost something proportional to the surrounding temperature. Most of what we do in life, we don\u2019t think of it as computation. We say that, \u201cNo, I\u2019m having social relations, I\u2019m trading, I\u2019m falling in love. And these are definitely not computations.\u201d But when you look at the deep down, this is actually about changing patterns of information. Maybe it is the change that really matters. But if there is no information change when you fall in love, then there is a real problem. Robert Wiblin: It\u2019s a bad relationship. Anders Sandberg: It\u2019s a very bad relationship. It\u2019s also a reversible relation. You can go back, and nobody will notice anything. So it\u2019s probably not very much to talk about. Robert Wiblin: I guess sometimes you might want to be able to do that, but perhaps you won\u2019t know whether you want to reverse the calculation in any romantic liaison until you\u2019ve already been through it. Anders Sandberg: Exactly. Evolution is another beautiful example. Evolution is a fundamentally irreversible process where you create various offspring, and they are subjected to selection effects in nature. Some of them are, unfortunately, erased. That is, they get killed, and the survivors continue a spread of their genes. Now, if evolution was reversible, we could unevolve. It would be kind of just a random drift in genotype space, and that would be tremendously slow. The fact is that this is irreversible means that we actually have a bit of momentum in evolution. Now, this means, of course with evolution again creates energy. So we have an energy cost for our activities, regardless of whether that is falling in love, evolving, or running a super civilization a million years since. So, we can say, \u201cLet\u2019s go to a cold place.\u201d And the coldest place you can get today, Iceland, is of course making a background radiation. Free Kelvin about absolute zero. By human standards, tremendously cold. And where would you run computations of that temperature? You wouldn\u2019t get a lot of stuff done. But wait a minute, the universe is expanding. It\u2019s actually getting colder, which means that, if you wait a bit with your computation you can do much more. In fact, accelerating expansion of the universe means that this background temperature is going down exponentially. So if I have a certain amount of energy right now, if I\u2019m willing to wait long enough I\u2019m going to get an exponentially growing amount of computation done. Now, for many things we don\u2019t really want to wait any longer. We have a short discomfort. We want to heal the sick today, we want to help the needy, we want to explore the universe and learn of the ropes as a civilization. We really shouldn\u2019t be putting that off onto tomorrow, even though it might be thermodynamically more effective. But once you\u2019re a fairly mature civilization and you\u2019ve done the basic things that are nice to do in the material world, now your discount rate is going to become much lower. You\u2019re going to care much more about the long term future. You have a lower existential risk because you survived and by now you actually know how to handle yourself as a mature civilization. At that point, if you just wait for a while, if you estimate a bit, you get much more computation. So if you imagine the real advanced civilization that has seen a lot of galaxy expanded long distances, once you\u2019ve seen a hundred elliptical galaxies and a hundred spiral galaxies, how many surprises are we going to be there? Now most of the interesting stuff your civilization is doing is going to be culture, science, philosophy, and all the other internal stuff. The external universe is nice scenery, but you\u2019ve seen much of it. So this leads to this possibility that maybe advanced civilization is actually an estimate. They slow down, they freeze themselves, and wait until a much later era because we get so much more. It turns out that you can calculate how much more they can get. So the background radiation of the universe is declining exponentially. But there\u2019s a lower limit because of the horizon radiation, which has a temperature of ten to the minus 29 Kelvin, a ridiculously low temperature. But we\u2019re going to be there in about one and a half trillion years. It\u2019s going to take a bit longer because with stars actually heating up the whole place and even when the stars have burned out in a few trillion years, they\u2019re going to be brown dwarfs, those being rather warm. But basically eventually the universe gets down to a cold temperature that will not become any colder. And that is perhaps a natural harvest time. At that point you wake up and you take your resources and actually get going on doing whatever it is that make your super civilization tick. Now, the interesting thing here is of course this might lead to a lot of predictions. It\u2019s a fun story to tell. You can make a very good science fiction story. But you can also start to see, \u201cWhat would this imply in terms of observable things in the universe?\u201d So one thing is, if advanced civilization is emerging early do this, they don\u2019t want to lose their resources because they are actually worth a lot. It turns out that if you take the mass energy of Earth today and wait until this very cold far future, and then use it up to do computation, you get about as much computation as you would get today if you used an entire observable universe as raw material for computation. A single planet is worth as much as the entire universe. So you really want to make sure that you don\u2019t lose too much resources. So one thing I was analyzing in this paper was, \u201cAre we seeing an astronomical process that looked like they\u2019re being suppressed so they don\u2019t waste too much mass and energy. And depending on what kind of civilization you\u2019re in, you might also want to care about different things. Some civilizations want energy. They want to run long computations or a lot of computations. Others want a lot of mass because they want a lot of memory. Some civilizations might need to keep mass together so it doesn\u2019t get dispersed by the expansion of the universe because it\u2019s actually important for all the parks to be together. While other civilizations might just say, \u201cI want to be able to convert all that matter into minds that are having blissful experiences of the maximal possible rate. And we don\u2019t care if one blissful cluster of minds can\u2019t talk to another blissful cluster of minds because as long as we\u2019re happy, that\u2019s fine. So you can kind of outline different aims in the civilization and then try to see what the astronomic approsa would they mess with. And the interesting part is we can rule out some things. It doesn\u2019t look like anybody\u2019s moving galaxies around in the visible universe. That would be very noticeable. And that suggests that there are no civilization that are actually trying to stay together casually, either because there are no civilizations or because maybe this is not a good idea. Maybe the hedonistic utilitarianism is the answer. So actually, most of the universe had been seeded by a valence , eventually it will be all converted into hedonium. So we can do various observations and rule out some sets of possibility space. Robert Wiblin: Just to backup a second, and make sure that I\u2019ve completely understood, the idea is if the goal of this civilization is to run calculations, then you can get a lot more calculations done if you wait until you have an extremely cold environment, and indeed the efficiency of the calculations is equal to one over the temperature in kelvin above absolute zero. And because the temperature is going to go from three kelvin now to one over ten to the power of thirty? Anders Sandberg: Yep. Robert Wiblin: You would, if you waited until the heat death of the universe, basically, or just before that, then you\u2019ll get 10 to the 30 times by three more calculations done than if you were to do it now, using the same method. Anders Sandberg: Exactly. Robert Wiblin: Can you explain why the energetic cost of running a given calculation is proportional to the temperature? Or is that quite complicated? Anders Sandberg: I think it\u2019s somewhat complicated. It\u2019s related to what\u2019s called the Landauer principle, although actually all the big names in 20th-century physics had something to do with this realization. When you erase one bit of information, you need to pay small thermodynamic cost. Basically, it has to do with that memory is a state that doesn\u2019t change over time. Then you have an outside world, which is kind of a heat bath. That\u2019s a lot of random things going on. You want to push the system into a particular state, and that requires interacting. The temperature matters. But it is pretty profound and important, I think we are still not fully understanding the full picture, here. The physics of information is a fascinating emerging field. The Landauer principle is a firsthand that there is actually a strong link between information and thermodynamics. Now quantum computing, and the quantum information theory is also getting in. We\u2019re starting to see the outline that information is something just as physical as entropy or energy. A century ago, of course, people would not even think that this was possible. We still don\u2019t fully understand this. There\u2019s some surprises. For example, it turns out that you don\u2019t always have to pay an energy cost for a racing a bit. If you have a very ordered, in essence, structure, let\u2019s say that you have a planet full of items that have all spends pointed in the same direction, by randomizing the spends a little bit, you can also erase information. Basically, there are some other resources and energy you can use, but it doesn\u2019t change the overall picture very much. Robert Wiblin: I suppose it\u2019s possible in our understanding of this is wrong, and the reason that this isn\u2019t happening is because we would eventually realize that it\u2019s wrong and not adopt the strategy, because it won\u2019t work, or there\u2019s something else that\u2019s better. That\u2019s right? Anders Sandberg: Yeah. Robert Wiblin: But it sounds like a pretty good approach. Sounds like, maybe, we should do this if humanity manages to stick around for a long time. Anders Sandberg: I definitely think so. One reason I wrote this paper wasn\u2019t so much the from the question as is this a good scenario for our future? Because when you start thinking about the future of humanity, it\u2019s interesting to consider what should we want to do, what can we do? How grand could the future be? It\u2019s quite useful to find the laws of physics that actually limit us to the ultimate extent. Robert Wiblin: Okay, but it doesn\u2019t seem like such a winner, because we don\u2019t see anyone apparently trying to do this. If you were a civilization that\u2019s contemplating this strategy, wouldn\u2019t you be worried about hibernating, basically, or aestivating, and then another civilization appears and it just takes over the universe while you\u2019re asleep. You need to be monitoring that, at least. You might, in fact, want to build quite a robust civilization, in a sense. Quite a visible civilization just to in order to make sure that you\u2019re taking care of yourself and you\u2019re going to last a very long time. Is that right? If you\u2019re aestivating, would you expect to be very visible or not very visible? Anders Sandberg: I think you don\u2019t need to be very visible in the sense that the thing that you really care about, the bunker where the aliens are sleeping, probably should be hidden very, very well. But you want to have an infrastructure. You want caretakers to make sure your galaxy doesn\u2019t go bad. Most importantly, things might evolve in your stuff. It\u2019s a bit like having a kitchen but leaving it too long. Eventually things evolve in the sink. You want to keep that under control. Robert Wiblin: You need to have some kind of error correction to make sure that you don\u2019t eventually deviate from the eventual original plan. Anders Sandberg: Yeah. Robert Wiblin: Or some part of you doesn\u2019t do that, like a tumor, like a cancer. Anders Sandberg: Yes. So this leads to other interesting aspects of this scenario. For the aestivation scenario to work, the civilization actually needs to be coordinated enough so everyone can agree, \u201cLet\u2019s sleep to until 2 trillion years.\u201d And nobody starts before and starts grabbing resources from the others. You need to have a pretty strong internal coordination. Then you want to enforce a certain coordination, both on the material universe in the sense that you don\u2019t lose too much and also that newcomers don\u2019t invade you, either because they come from abroad, you get an invasion from the neighboring galactic supercluster, or that some monkeys on some planet evolve and start to gobbling up planet and doing all sorts of mess. This shades over into what\u2019s sometimes called the zoo hypothesis in discussions about alien intelligence. The idea that the aliens are around, but we don\u2019t notice them that they\u2019re looking at us and letting us behave. Now the interesting question with the zoo hypothesis is what actions are not permitted? Because if the aestivation hypothesis is true, we should expect that starting to blow up stars and doing things that really reduce the value in the long-term future should be strongly prohibited. Presumably, that also involves sending out self replicating probes and really doing things. At that- Robert Wiblin: Creating kind of a virus on the space that they want. Anders Sandberg: Exactly. So you should expect some process to prevent that. Now, you could imagine the space police. Essentially you put little robots in the systems and when a civilization emerges and starts messing around with stuff they\u2019re not supposed to, the space police shows up and tells them, \u201cNo, the rules in this galaxy are as follows. Don\u2019t do this, don\u2019t do this, and if you do that, well, that\u2019s totally okay.\u201d We haven\u2019t seen this, yet. It might be an interesting thing to test, of course. It\u2019s a very risky thing to test, for example, by building a self replicating space probe. If nothing stops you from doing that, then you can be fairly certain that you don\u2019t have any overseers handling things. The zoo hypothesis probably not a viable solution. The problem is, of course, instead of a friendly neighborhood space policeman, you might just have a big asteroid coming in. It is a bit risky to test. Robert Wiblin: The other question was, if your civilization planning to do this, you might want to, for example, stop the stars from burning, because that\u2019s going to preserve more energy, more matter, until the end of the universe. Anders Sandberg: That is actually an interesting thing that is probably not true. It seems tremendously wasteful to have stars shining. When you think about the sheer amount of energy they\u2019re releasing, that seems like it\u2019s a total waste. Except that it\u2019s about 0.5 percent of the mass energy that\u2019s what gets converted into light and heat. The rest is just getting into heavy nuclei. If you can convert mass into energy, you might actually not care too much about stopping stars. If the process of turning off stars is more costly than 0.5% of the total mass energy, then you will not be doing it. I can certainly imagine that I would like to build Dyson shells and scoop up the energy right now and use for some nice things, but it might be that in the long run this is simply not worth the effort. It\u2019s interesting that the scale we\u2019re talking about here makes things like galaxies, you might actually afford to lose a few galaxies if that streamlines your process. It\u2019s still kind of telling that, yeah, we don\u2019t seek any process preventing the emergence of blue white heavy stars that will turn into black holes and probably become fairly unusable. There are ways of preventing that from happening by iron seeding galactic gas clouds. The increased capacity means that when they collapse, they turn into smaller stars. Recent calculations are done suggests that actually maybe you don\u2019t even need to do that. Because that\u2019s really, you anyway get so much more long-lived red dwarfs stars that you actually don\u2019t need to worry about these blue white stars. Because we, right now, we\u2019re in all of them. We see them across the star. This is just this very early part of the coniferous era. Wait a few tens of billions of years and you\u2019re not going to have that many blue white stars. The universe is going to be much more staid and middle-aged. You\u2019re going to have a lot of orange and red stars. Maybe it\u2019s not actually even worth iron seeding the clouds because, well, you don\u2019t need it. The interesting thing about this kind of hypothesis is, of course, what\u2019s the value in proceeding pursuing it? I did it partially because I wanted to calculate rational strategy for humanity but it also shows how weird many of the possible explanations for the Fermi paradox are. If you don\u2019t accept that we are alone, which as I mentioned earlier I think is actually a plausible outcome, something is really odd about the universe. Something extremely strange is going on. Either something like the zoo hypothesis or the simulation hypothesis. Or that the intelligence always has very strong sociological convergence to behaving in a particular way or that it works itself out. You get a really strange and uncomfortable conclusion whatever the answer to the Fermi paradox is. Robert Wiblin: What probability do you place on this being the explanation for the Fermi paradox? Anders Sandberg: I think I will give perhaps 10% probability to the aestivation hypothesis. Maybe just because I came up with it, I\u2019m fond of it. I don\u2019t believe in it that strongly. I heard people being based surprised. \u201cWhy do you even write a paper about something you don\u2019t believe in?\u201d Obviously, they have never met a philosopher because philosophers do this all the time. Sometimes a line of thought is interesting to pursue.  I think we have learned a lot of things from pursuing this. I think the real value is, yeah, we can think and plan for the extreme long-range future. Right now, we need to have a sustainable civilization. We need to fix existential risk. We need to get our act together and become a more mature civilization. But beyond that point, we probably should think about our long-term future. What\u2019s the pension plan for intelligence in the universe? Robert Wiblin: You\u2019ve been mapping out the space of possible options. I guess this is one that\u2019s a bit weird, but in your view, not completely implausible. There\u2019s a decent chance that this is what\u2019s going on. Anders Sandberg: Yeah. Robert Wiblin: You pointed out that if we start using up the cosmic comments that the aliens that are aestivating might want to wipe us out so that we don\u2019t end up taking things over and drinking their milkshake. But there\u2019s another possibility that you\u2019ve considered, which is the Berserker hypothesis, which is a bit similar. Do you want to explain that? Anders Sandberg: So, the name the Berserker hypothesis haven\u2019t got much to do with inebriated Vikings rushing around. It\u2019s named after a series of science fiction novels by Fred Saberhagen, which is based on the idea that some alien civilization in the remote past built self-replicating killing machines. Not just autonomous lethal weapons, but star-faring autonomous lethal weapons that could build more of themselves. And then they wiped out the creators and now they\u2019re around wiping out all life they can find. Now, this idea has been around in the discussions about why we\u2019re not observing any aliens, like, \u201cOh, maybe something like this is true. There are something dangerous out there wiping out civilization. The only surviving civilizations are the very quiet ones that don\u2019t make a fuss of themselves, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re not observing anything.\u201d This has never been a super popular theory, not just because it\u2019s slightly dark, but also because it seems so darn science fictional, and many people are turned off from that because it seems like you can\u2019t make a rigorous argument about it. But I have been looking into it and I think I have some decent argument why this seems unlikely. And you can actually make an ecological argument. If you have self-replicating systems hiding out there amongst the stars, what if somebody were releasing another strain of them? Well, they would need to wipe that one out, of course. It\u2019s also an opponent. So, when you try to model the ecosystems, you find that it doesn\u2019t seem to be a stable equilibrium situation. Instead you end up with more and more resources being used to build more and more killing machines against the other killing machines and you end up with a universe that looks very different from ours. Basically, it\u2019s gigantic space warfare everywhere, which should be pretty obvious. But there\u2019s not- Robert Wiblin: So, this would make sense if one group did it, but not if it was a very common thing that almost all civilizations do when they\u2019re very numerous, because then you would see a huge ware going on, basically. Anders Sandberg: Yeah. And even if you don\u2019t have that many civilizations, it needs to be robust. In order to work as an explanation against the Fermi Paradox, it needs to be able to withstand that a civilization shows up somewhere and tries to get in on the game. So, they need to be effective at wiping out civilizations, and if civilizations manage to launch their own replicators, they must somehow be able to wipe out those replicators, too. And it\u2019s an interesting thing, but took us about 100 years since Hertz sent the first radio waves until we were doing fairly regular space flight. We still haven\u2019t really colonized the solar system, but we could imagine a counterfactual world where we really pushed for that, and then we would probably have something like the 2001 universe with the moon base and things like that. So, I think it\u2019s not implausible, but you could, maybe takes 100 to 200 years if you\u2019re fast for a civilization to go from radio to being out in space and being very hard to wipe out. So, that would suggest that if you have these self-replicating killer machines out there, they need to intervene within a century. Otherwise, civilizations are going to get away, and you don\u2019t have a proper explanation for the Fermi paradox. Now, you can do a probability test, given that we\u2019re still around here, and that\u2019s starting to show that it looks pretty implausible that this hypothesis is true. It\u2019s more likely that actually there are no killing machines, because otherwise the system would seem to actually not work very well. Now, there is a sting in the tail, though, because what\u2019s the best defense against self-replicating machines that want to attack you? Well, you want your defense machines. You want your police system. You want to actually have your own defenses out there, and if they notice some alien device trying to blow up your star, or throw asteroids at you, or do something else nasty, it should stop it. So, you need your police systems and they need to be widely dispersed and self-repairing and basically end up with self-replicating interstellar killing machines. But these ones are on our side, so they\u2019re Freedom Fighters, and the police, and lawful. So, you have a symmetric situation. I think advanced civilizations will probably surround themselves with a swarm of support systems, whether they\u2019re really intelligent and independent or very simple might depend very much on values and safety. But you should expect them to have a lot of autonomous systems that actually support them and protect them. So, that might actually be the most likely artifact we find from an alien civilization. Robert Wiblin: When I heard this hypothesis, my initial reaction was, \u201cWhy would anyone make these probes?\u201d So, if you\u2019re the first group in the universe and you assume that you\u2019re alone, why would you create Berserker killing machines that kill you and kill anything? Is this meant to be an accident or a deliberate strategy? Anders Sandberg: So, in Saberhagen\u2019s novels, I think the idea was that it was an accident. And you can certainly imagine a civilization that does something stupid. You can also imagine a civilization that has really weird values, saying like, \u201cOh, life is really bad. We are radical negative utilitarians, we just want to wipe out all life henceforth, so let\u2019s unleash these devices even though they attack us.\u201d That might seem relatively unlikely. You can also have something like the green aliens that decide, \u201cOh, the universe looks lovely and we\u2019re gonna prevent people from industrializing it or changing it too much. So, we actually just want to have these out and keeping things in order.\u201d And then you can, of course, add more and more various assumptions. Like somebody thinking, \u201cMaybe there are green aliens out there. We don\u2019t know yet whether we want to industrialize the universe, but we want to retain our options, so we want to have our police systems getting our space.\u201d Basically you have quite a lot of very different goals that lead to the launch of these systems. Certainly there might be some civilizations just going, \u201cWhat? Why should anybody care about this? We\u2019ve got it nice here on our planet. We\u2019re gonna stay here. We\u2019re not gonna mess with it.\u201d But if they don\u2019t do that, then we\u2019re of course going to be at the mercy of a civilization that do some form of this replicating, spreading influences. So, it seems to be an attractive point, even though what you then use it for is very dependent on your own aims philosophically and culturally. Robert Wiblin: But you\u2019ve come up with some arguments for thinking that this actually isn\u2019t as likely as it might first seem. So, what probability do you place on it, all things considered? Anders Sandberg: I think I would assign much less probability to this, perhaps one percent or less. Robert Wiblin: That\u2019s a relief, I guess. Anders Sandberg: It\u2019s a bit of a relief. It\u2019s also an interesting challenge, because we might then consider should we do it? Even if we think that we might be alone in the universe, actually having an expanding infrastructure could be useful, even if we haven\u2019t yet decided what it\u2019s for, especially if there might be something dangerous or scary out there. So, at the very least, many people would say we should be sending out replicating probes just to observe the universe. Now, the problem here is of course, if you have something that replicated a number of times, you might worry about it evolving. Errors happen, mutations happen. Many people underestimate how unreliable you can make technology. You can actually use error correcting codes to make it very unlikely. Essentially, probability one, it will not once in the history of the universe actually change its programming. That is very, very easy to do if you design it well. However, you might also say, \u201cYeah, but you can also have cultures and settlements. If we go out and colonize space, some of those settlements in space, we\u2019ll also colonize.\u201d And now you have another form of replication. Not so much our machines, but our cultures, and cultures change. So you could imagine a culture being very keen on colonizing, and they will of course want to send out many colony ships and colonizing other planets, and before you know it, you have a lot of pro-colonization planets that are sending out more and more ships, and then you eventually approach some kind of interstellar intergalactic locust storm just living for settling more and more worlds, which might not be a good use of the resources of the universe. So, this scenario is called Burning the Cosmic Commons. It\u2019s originally by Robin Hanson. But notice what\u2019s going on here. You have a lot of generations that allow you to converge to something. If you could spread over vast regions without having too many steps, you might avoid this. So, in a paper I did with Stuart Armstrong, we analyzed exactly how far can you spread using the resources of one solar system, and we found that if you take apart the planet Mercury, which today might sound like a very tall order, but on the astronomical scale, it\u2019s actually fairly small. It takes a few decades if you do it at a leisurely pace. You can build enough solar collectors to use an afternoon sunlight to launch probes to all reachable galaxies. These probes don\u2019t have to be very large. Essentially you want something that can land on an asteroid, build solar panels, build more equipment, mine that, and build something including of course, things to seed other systems. Robert Wiblin: So, you just need the seed to get things started? Anders Sandberg: Yes. Robert Wiblin: Although I guess it has to be able to grow in a wide variety of different environments that you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re gonna be arriving. Anders Sandberg: That is an interesting issue, because when we start talking about space colonization, typically we are stuck in this mode of thinking that there has to be the kind of blonde guy from the space patrol landing his spacecraft on a weird planet where the sky has some random color. And in that case, you get a lot of very different environment, because we are interested in this very unusual terrestrial planet. But if you look at the solar system, most surfaces are essentially asteroid regolith. It\u2019s dry gravel in microgravity with various levels of water and iron in it. Robert Wiblin: And solar energy reaching them. Anders Sandberg: Yeah. They are very, very homogeneous. So, if you can make something that can mine that kind of asteroid, and they seem to be ubiquitous across the universe, then you have an ecological niche which is ridiculously large. Yes, there are gas giants and planetary surfaces that are very different that these devices would not be directly able to make use of, but this is already enough to build a lot of stuff, including of course maybe habitats where you can then culture the cells and have humans grow up, or if you have artificial intelligence or uploaded minds, live in software. The point is, the universe is actually very homogeneous, so you could spread across the big universe over ridiculous distances. It\u2019s actually easier to send a space probe that can travel over interstellar distances to another galaxy than across our galaxy. And the reason is when you have a space probe that\u2019s moving very fast, if it runs into a piece of gravel, bang. That\u2019s going to do a lot of damage. The closer you are to light speed, the more energy you get and essentially when you are in a few tenths of percent of light speed, now you\u2019re starting to look like grenades and small nuclear explosions, which is not very good for your probes. You might want to send more redundancy, but if you have dust cloud, you\u2019re pretty likely to run into something. But between the galaxies, the coast is very clear. So, if we could send probes at a distance of 7.7 light year, then we could hop between stars and reach most of the Milky Way. If it goes slightly shorter, then we kind of strand on a little island. If you can send it at 7.7 light year, you can probably send much more, and it turns out that to reach essentially all galaxies within five giga parsec, well, they only need to be able to travel a few million light years in order to do that. But most likely, if you can travel a few million light years, you can use the same probe and travel a billion light years. So, the main problem here in expanding over ridiculously large distances is basically how much dust is in the way. That determines how many probes you need to send or if you need to go around with us, and how fast can you go, which is perhaps the most important thing. Because right now, we have sent a probe that could have reached another solar system, the Voyager probe. It\u2019s not aimed anywhere in particular, it\u2019s just going to float through space. But we could have aimed it so it would eventually get to our solar system in a few tens of thousands of years. It wouldn\u2019t do anything useful, of course, except bearing that plaque and that recording of the music of Earth, but with 1970s technology, we could already reach the stars. We might want to go much faster, of course, and that is the interesting part here. Speed seems to be what really wins. So, when we\u2019re considering whether we should start colonizing the universe now or wait, it actually turns out that if we wait for a while, and the universe expands, some galaxies become harder to reach, but we presumably have better technology and once you can move really fast, that\u2019s actually the best way of reaching remote galaxies. So, you really want to go very close to light speed. Not super close, because then you run into dust. But if you can get up to 90% of light speed, you get most of the reachable universe. There is an upper limit, because there are galaxies we can see, but we can never, ever touch. Even if we went at exactly light speed, we would never catch up with them before they ran away from us because of expansion. Robert Wiblin: And how is this probe gonna slow down once it gets to far away galaxies? Anders Sandberg: So, in our paper, we did models where we imagined that it essentially had a little rocket. So, we assumed the launch was using a coil gun, essentially electromagnetic coils accelerating the probes to a higher and higher speed. You can probably do this much better with a laser, but we didn\u2019t do that calculation in the paper. But when it arrives, you would have this retro rocket, then we analyzed what could happen if you had a nuclear rocket, a fusion rocket, and an antimatter rocket. And that is, of course, pushing the limits of technology. We haven\u2019t build that kind of rocket very well yet. But we think we understand the physics well enough. However, you might not even need to slow down that way, because the expansion of the universe means that you actually need a lot of velocity to catch up with remote galaxies. So, if you\u2019re aiming at the remote galaxy, as you\u2019re traveling, it will move away from you faster and faster, and if you time things right, you will arrive with zero velocity. Your rocket will kind of just drift in and park itself there. So, you might actually not need all of this fancy technology to slow things down. Or you might use things like creating an electromagnetic field around it to slow it down by passing through gas clouds. So, there are quite a lot of options here, but I do find it fun, the fact that the expansion of the universe itself can be used as a braking method. Robert Wiblin: So, if you were really committed to colonizing as much of the universe as you could, would the best strategy be to spread out to the surface of the sphere that you can reach in every direction, and then once you\u2019ve reached the outer limit, then move back inwards, back towards the core? Anders Sandberg: Not really, because by the point you reach that outer limit, the farthest galaxy we can reach, now the center, the solar system has become unreachable. Robert Wiblin: Okay. Anders Sandberg: Because- Robert Wiblin: You can\u2019t get back. Anders Sandberg: Yes. There exists actually a distance about halfway from an event horizon that is the outer part we can reach, which is the point where that\u2019s the further you can go and then send a message back to Earth. So, if we actually want to inventory everything that exists, see if there is any aliens, and we are committed to staying ourselves on Earth, that is as far as we can go. We can only get about 2.5 giga parsecs worth of data. So, the best strategy I think is you send out probes, a few of them, to every reachable galaxy, and that\u2019s literally millions if you only travel by a few percent of light speed and billions if you\u2019re kind of at 90% of light speed. And once they have arrived somewhere in that galaxy, that\u2019s a random star, they pick up a random asteroid, they start building infrastructure. They build a little Dyson shell, and now we send out 300 billion probes to the nearby stars in the galaxy. Now we have two generations from the solar system to every solar system that can be reached. Now, this of course, avoids that Burning of the Cosmic Common thing. We only use a ridiculously small amount of resources, essentially a Mercury sized planet in every galaxy. Big on our current civilizational scale, of course, but on the cosmological scale, this is totally invisible, it\u2019s really tiny. And what do you do with all this? Well, that depends on your values. That depends on the programming you put into the probes. So, this might be that you just get the data, you might set up policing so no aliens or human colonies do anything. You might colonize it all. You might set it up so after aestivating in the far future, you\u2019re gonna fill it with happy human or alien minds. Or something else. So, this is an estimate of how much power any intelligent species can have over the material universe. Robert Wiblin: What\u2019s the name for this strategy of you\u2019re trying to reach everywhere very quickly? Anders Sandberg: So, the paper, we called that Eternity in Six Hours, but my nickname for the paper is Spamming the Universe. Robert Wiblin: Why six hours? Anders Sandberg: Well, it turns out that you only need six hours of sunlight to actually power all the probes to go to all of the reachable galaxies. Robert Wiblin: Nice. Nice. We\u2019ve done about an hour here on these grand possible futures across the entire universe. Maybe let\u2019s bring it back towards more practical decisions that people might be able to make now. Anders Sandberg: Well, I think it\u2019s actually worth recognizing also why one should want to think about this form of stuff, because this is really about the value of a very, very far future, and it\u2019s actually the path that led me to think about existential risk and many more other practical things. As a kid, I read Barrow and Tipler\u2019s The Anthropic Cosmological Principle, which is an amazing work, and the final chapter was talking about intelligence taking over the universe, overcoming the heat death of the universe, and essentially affecting all things affectable. That was kind of my brush with religion as a young nerd. Over time, their physical theory has had some problems, but the overall idea about what is the value of the far future is important, because that gives us a reason, of course, to try to defend the future. We want to avoid existential risk that could mean that we would never get this grand future. We might want to avoid doing stupid things that limit our future. We might want to avoid doing things that create enormous suffering or disvalue in these futures. So, what I\u2019ve been talking about here is kind of our understanding about how big the future is, and then that leads to questions like, \u201cWhat do we need to figure out right now to get it?\u201d Some things are obvious, like reducing existential risk. Making sure we survive and thrive. Making sure we have an open future. Some of it might be more subtle, like how do we coordinate once we start spreading out very far? Right now, we are within one seventh of a second away from each other. All humans are on the same planet or just above it. That\u2019s not going to be true forever. Eventually, we are going to be dispersed so much that you can\u2019t coordinate, and we might want to figure out some things that should be true for all our descendants. Robert Wiblin: So, your point is that once we\u2019ve spread out across the universe so far, then there\u2019s no way of sending messages to tell everyone what to do. They all have to be working on the original instructions and interpreting them in the right way, otherwise they\u2019ll get out of sync? Anders Sandberg: Exactly. And for many situations, this is totally fine. You don\u2019t need a central planet to tell you what kind of art or philosophy to work on, perhaps. But we might want to have some ground rules that\u2019s always true. If we encounter aliens, well, what are our plans for how to divide the universe with them? Because once you spread out of sufficiently long distances, given that it doesn\u2019t look likely that the supraliminal communication and travel is possible, that means that parts of your civilization will never be in causal contact. And there might be things for the really far future where we need to coordinate across these causal boundaries. Some really big engineering things involves actually planning that, \u201cOkay, in a hundred billion years, we want the galaxy clusters to be organized like this.\u201d There might be moral things that we want to avoid certain moral hazards. And that suggests that we might want to think about how we want to set up a process now, over the next few hundred years. Whether that is years, or decades, or centuries, when we\u2019re all on one planet or in one solar system, before we start doing the grand stuff, so we don\u2019t mess it up too much. Robert Wiblin: Reminds me slightly of, I think during the British Empire, there were various points when a particular colony could be out of touch with London for months or even years, \u2019cause it took so long to send messages and people weren\u2019t traveling there very frequently. But it\u2019s a much more extreme example of that where you never get messages back and you can never talk to them anymore. Interesting.

But how much does the practice really change our health? In late 1971, US Navy veteran Stephen Islas returned from Vietnam, but the war continued to rage in his head. \u201cI came very close to committing suicide when I came home, I was that emotionally and mentally damaged,\u201d Islas remembers. At his college campus in Los Angeles, a friend suggested he check out a meditation class. He was sceptical, but he found that before long \u201cthere were moments that started shifting, where I was happy. I would experience these glimpses of calmness.\u201d Forty-six years later, Islas says that he has never completely freed himself from his post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which was formally diagnosed in 2000 at the Veterans Affairs (VA) West Los Angeles Medical Center. But he\u2019s convinced that meditation has saved his life. Various forms of meditation are now routinely offered to veterans with PTSD. It\u2019s also touted as a therapeutic tool to help anyone suffering from conditions and disorders including stress, anxiety, depression, addiction and chronic pain. More broadly, meditation has come into vogue as a way to enhance human performance, finding its way into classrooms, businesses, sports locker rooms and people\u2019s smartphones through Internet apps like Headspace and Calm. You might also like:\u2022 Can meditation prevent the effects of ageing? \u2022 An effortless way to improve your memory \u2022 Why it pays to be grumpy and bad-tempered \u2018Mindfulness\u2019 meditation, a type of meditation that focuses the mind on the present moment, is wildly popular. It has even become a billion-dollar business. For all its popularity, however, it\u2019s still unclear exactly what mindfulness meditation does to the human brain, how it influences health and to what extent it helps people suffering from physical and mental challenges. Meditation has been practiced for thousands of years, but psychologists and neuroscientists have studied it for only a few decades.  Some studies suggest that meditation can help people relax, manage chronic stress and even reduce reliance on pain medication. Some of the most impressive studies to date involve a treatment called mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, which combines meditation with psychotherapy to help patients deal with thoughts that lead to depression. Randomised controlled trials have shown that the approach significantly reduces the risk of depression relapse in individuals who have previously had three or more major depressive episodes. But many other studies on the effects of meditation have used only small numbers of subjects, lacked follow-up and generally been less scientifically rigorous than other medical studies \u2013 clinical trials for new drugs, for example. A 2017 article that assessed evidence on meditation as a treatment for PTSD summed up the overall state of affairs: \u201cThis line of research is in its relative infancy.\u201d  While questions about the clinical outcomes of meditation persist, other studies have focused on a more fundamental issue: does meditation physically change the brain? It\u2019s a tough question to answer, but as brain imaging techniques have advanced and meditation interventions have grown more popular, scientists have begun to take a systematic look at what\u2019s going on. Seeking stillness Meditation that requires one to sit still and focus on the mere act of breathing can encourage mindfulness, says psychologist David Creswell, who directs the Health and Human Performance Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. But most people spend most or all of their day being anything but mindful. They skip from one thought to another. They daydream. They ruminate about the past, and they worry about the future. They self-analyse and self-criticise.  In a 2010 study, Harvard researchers asked 2,250 adults about their thoughts and actions at moments throughout their day via an iPhone app. People\u2019s minds wandered 47% of the time and mind wandering often triggered unhappiness, the scientists reported in Science.  The capacity to be mindful is associated with higher well-being in daily life \u2013 David Creswell  \u201cIn contrast, the capacity to be mindful is associated with higher well-being in daily life,\u201d Creswell wrote in the 2017 Annual Review of Psychology. He cites a 2003 study showing a correlation between mindfulness and a number of indicators of well-being.  When people who meditate say they are paying attention to the present moment, they may be focused on their breathing, but maybe also on an emotion that surfaces and then passes, a mental image, inner chatter or a sensation in the body. \u201cAdopting an attitude of openness and acceptance toward one\u2019s experience is critical\u201d to becoming more mindful, Creswell says. The idea is to be view these moments with a detached and non-judgmental curiosity. Creswell first became interested in mindfulness meditation when he took courses on psychology and Buddhism in high school. Later, in graduate school, he began studying meditation in connection with reducing stress and improving overall health. \u201cAs a scientist, I\u2019m never convinced. I\u2019ve been trained to be sceptical,\u201d Creswell says. \u201cNonetheless, I do think that there were a number of experiences I had while on meditation retreats that really struck me as very foundational.\u201d Even the simple but challenging act of sitting still for an hour while meditating made a great impact on Creswell. \u201cHaving this disconnect between my body feeling in pain but my mind being completely silent and open\u2026 these were very powerful insights for me about how a [meditation] practice could really change people\u2019s lives, or fundamentally change how they relate to suffering in their lives,\u201d he says. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a bolt-of-lightning moment for me, but a lot of these moments of insight in my own retreat experiences that suggested to me that it was worth spending time and effort to do the science.\u201d People from different religious, cultural and philosophical backgrounds have expounded the benefits of meditation for millennia. Meditation is perhaps most commonly associated with Buddhism, which views it as an instrument for achieving spiritual fulfilment and peace. Creswell calls the act of meditation \u201ca basic feature of being human.\u201d  But the scientific evidence for its benefits is still lacking.  Mindfulness-based therapies have shown a mixture of only moderate, low or no efficacy, depending on the disorder being treated  \u201cThere is a common misperception in public and government domains that compelling clinical evidence exists for the broad and strong efficacy of mindfulness as a therapeutic intervention,\u201d a group of 15 scholars wrote in a recent article entitled Mind the Hype. The reality is that mindfulness-based therapies have shown \u201ca mixture of only moderate, low or no efficacy, depending on the disorder being treated,\u201d the scholars wrote, citing a 2014 meta-analysis commissioned by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Much more research is needed before scientists can say what mental and physical disorders, in which individuals, can be effectively treated with mindfulness meditation, they concluded. Mudra mind  Alongside clinical work, neuroscientists have wanted to know how, if at all, meditation might change what actually happens inside the brain. Does meditation make certain regions more active than others, or more robustly connect one region to another? Does meditation result in new neurons, actually changing brain structure? Some studies suggest the answer is yes.  Mindfulness meditation may spark neuroplastic renovations in the brain\u2019s function and structure  Neuroscientists have studied the physical effects of mindfulness meditation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and other techniques for the last two decades. Progress has followed on the growing recognition that the human brain is capable of physical changes throughout adulthood, even into old age \u2013 forming new connections and growing new neurons when someone learns a new skill, challenges themselves mentally or even just exercises. The emerging view of a brain that can be continually shaped through experience, dubbed neuroplasticity, replaced the long-held idea that after the first few decades of life, the brain\u2019s physiological trajectory was basically one of decline. A number of brain studies suggest that mindfulness meditation may spark neuroplastic renovations in the brain\u2019s function and structure.  Looking under the hood with fMRI, scientists have found that mindfulness meditation activates a network of brain regions that includes the insula (associated with compassion, empathy and self-awareness), the putamen (learning) and portions of the anterior cingulate cortex (regulating blood pressure, heart rate and other autonomic functions) and the prefrontal cortex (the hub of higher-order thinking skills such as planning, decision-making and moderating social behaviour). It\u2019s uncertain, however, whether these changes in brain activity can be sustained when the individual is not actively meditating, and if so how much people need to meditate for that to happen. When it comes to actual structural changes in the brain, some studies suggest that mindfulness meditation may increase grey matter density in the hippocampus, a brain region essential to memory. Researchers including Britta H\u00f6lzel, now at the Technical University of Munich, and Sara Lazar of Massachusetts General Hospital found evidence for this in a 2011 study. Though intriguing, these studies are nowhere near the end goal. \u201cWe need to understand the benefits that the changes in the brain have on behaviour and well-being,\u201d H\u00f6lzel says. \u201c\u2018Changing the brain\u2019 sounds very impressive, but we don\u2019t understand what it actually means.\u201d Lazar agrees. \u201cMost of the data has only looked at changes over the course of two months of [meditation] practice\u2026 Most people feel that [meditation] continues to change and get deeper with extended practice. So we need to conduct studies that follow people for much longer time points.\u201d Brain wave Based on their studies of people engaged in meditation, Creswell and his colleagues have proposed that mindfulness acts as a buffer specifically against stress. It does this by increasing activity in regions of the prefrontal cortex that are important for \u201ctop-down stress regulation\u201d, while reducing activity and functional connectivity in regions associated with the brain\u2019s fight-or-flight stress response \u2013 in particular the amygdala. The idea that mindfulness meditation engages parts of the brain involved in top-down stress regulation is widely accepted among researchers, says University of Michigan clinical psychologist Anthony King. But what\u2019s happening in relation to the amygdala is less clear, he says. The amygdala, one of the most primitive parts of the brain, is not just a simple alarm centre associated with responding to threats. It\u2019s central to what\u2019s called the salience network, which is vital for noticing all kinds of important things in one\u2019s environment. In a mother, for example, the amygdala may become very active in response to her baby\u2019s joyful face.  Mindfulness meditation \u201chelps people have what the old school psychotherapists call \u2018reflective capacity,\u2019\u201d King says. \u201cInstead of automatically responding in certain ways, it allows people to have more nuance in their ability to respond to any type of situation \u2013 stressful, fearful or otherwise \u2013 and create some psychological distance.\u201d Two studies by Creswell and his colleagues, one in 2015 and the other in 2016, offer some initial findings that seem to support their view of mindfulness meditation as a buffer against stress. Both studies focused on the physiological effects of mindfulness mediation training on small groups of unemployed adults experiencing stress.  In the 2015 study, the researchers found that three days of intensive mindfulness meditation training reduced functional connectivity between the right amygdala, associated with the fight-or-flight stress response, and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, which plays a role in modulating emotions. In the 2016 study, the researchers found that three days of intensive mindfulness meditation training led to increased connectivity between the default mode network, a network of regions engaged when the brain is at rest, and parts of the prefrontal cortex involved in regulating stress. The study also found that meditation led to reduced levels of interleukin-6, a biomarker in the blood for systemic inflammation that\u2019s elevated in high-stress populations. King and his colleagues showed similarly promising results in 23 combat veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq with post-traumatic stress disorder in 2016. Brain scans before and after mindfulness-based group therapy revealed an increase in resting-state connectivity between a network in the brain that allows people to control their attention and other parts of the brain involved in rumination and spontaneous thought. This particular connectivity has been seen in healthy people, as well as people who have meditated for long periods, says King. \u201cWhat\u2019s important about our study\u2026 is that people with PTSD can also have this change in brain connectivity patterns when they do mindfulness practice,\u201d King says. The more this connectivity increases as a result of mindfulness training, \u201cthe more their symptoms improve,\u201d he adds, summarising a key finding of the study.  Studies of other conditions suggest similar improvements, although many involve small numbers of subjects and other limitations that make them far from conclusive.  Mindfulness meditation may alleviate symptoms of general anxiety disorder  Nevertheless, mindfulness meditation may alleviate symptoms of general anxiety disorder by increasing connectivity between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex, thereby increasing a patient\u2019s ability to regulate emotions. Meditation may also lessen the perception of pain by reducing pain-related activation of the somatosensory cortex and increasing activation of areas involved in the cognitive regulation of pain. Work ahead Fundamentally, mindfulness is an elusive quality to study. It\u2019s an internally generated experience, not a drug that scientists can give to a patient. That creates a question when comparing mindfulness between individuals and especially between distinct studies. What\u2019s more, there is no universally accepted definition of mindfulness or agreement among researchers on the details of what it entails, Lazar and her colleagues note in the Perspectives on Psychological Science article.  In the context of PTSD, King says it\u2019s likely that mindfulness meditation will continue to supplement more conventional psychiatric treatments. \u201cI would never recommend for people to go to a mindfulness class at the YMCA or the local health centre and think that that\u2019s going to be the same as psychotherapy, because it is not. It really is not,\u201d King says. But \u201cI think mindfulness is a useful technique in the context of therapy with somebody who\u2019s trained in PTSD treatment.\u201d But people like Islas who have faced serious mental illness, and others who use mindfulness meditation to ease daily stress, say they\u2019re convinced the practice improves their lives. One day, scientists hope to be able to link that experience to what\u2019s physically happening in the meditating mind.

Today, that idea is thriving\u2014billions of people around the world rely on their Android phone every day.  To make Android smarter and easier to use than ever, today we\u2019re unveiling a beta version of Android P, the next release of Android. Android P makes your smartphone smarter, helping it learn from and adapt to you. Take battery life, for instance\u2014I think all of us often wish we had more of it. In Android P, we partnered with DeepMind to build Adaptive Battery, which prioritizes battery power only for the apps and services you use the most, to help you squeeze the most out of your battery. We also used machine learning to create Adaptive Brightness, which learns how you like to set the brightness slider given your surroundings. Across the platform, your phone will help you better navigate your day, using context to give you smart suggestions based on what you like to do the most and automatically anticipating your next action. App Actions, for instance, help you get to your next task more quickly by predicting what you want to do next. Say you connect your headphones to your device, Android will surface an action to resume your favorite Spotify playlist. Actions show up throughout Android in places like the Launcher, Smart Text Selection, the Play Store, the Google Search app and the Assistant.  Adaptive Battery App Actions Slices We want the entire device experience to be smarter, not just the OS, so we\u2019re bringing the power of Google\u2019s machine learning to app developers with the launch of ML Kit, a new set of cross-platform APIs available through Firebase. ML Kit offers developers on-device APIs for text recognition, face detection, image labeling and more. So mobile developers building apps like Lose It!, a nutrition tracker, can easily deploy our text recognition model to scan nutritional information and ML Kit\u2019s custom model APIs to automatically classify over 200 different foods with your phone\u2019s camera.  With Android P, we put a special emphasis on simplicity. The look and feel of Android is more approachable with a brand new system navigation. In Android P, we\u2019re extending gestures to enable navigation right from your homescreen. This is especially helpful as phones grow taller and it\u2019s more difficult to get things done on your phone with one hand. With a single, clean home button, you can swipe up to see a newly designed Overview, the spot where at a glance you have full-screen previews of your recently used apps. Simply tap to jump back into one of them. If you find yourself constantly switching between apps, we\u2019ve got good news for you: Smart Text Selection (which recognizes the meaning of the text you\u2019re selecting and suggests relevant actions) now works in Overview, making it easier to perform the action you want. Changing how you navigate your phone is a big deal, but small changes can make a big difference too. Android P also brings a redesigned Quick Settings, a better way to take and edit screenshots (say goodbye to the vulcan grip that was required before), simplified volume controls, an easier way to manage notifications and more. You\u2019ll notice small changes like these across the platform, to help make the things you do all the time easier than ever. \u00a0 Dashboard, App Timer, Wind Down Beyond smarts, simplicity and digital wellbeing, there are hundreds of additional improvements coming in Android P, including security and privacy improvements such as DNS over TLS, encrypted backups, Protected Confirmations and more.\u00a0\u00a0 Android P Beta is available today on Google Pixel. And thanks to work on Project Treble, an effort we introduced last year to make OS upgrades easier for partners, a number of our partners are making Android P Beta available today on their own devices, including Sony Xperia XZ2, Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S, Nokia 7 Plus, Oppo R15 Pro, Vivo X21, OnePlus 6, and Essential PH\u20111.\u00a0\u00a0 Since we first launched Android ten years ago, we\u2019ve been focused on how to build a platform for everyone. Android P is an important step toward bringing machine learning to everyone with an operating system that learns from you, adapts to you and helps you with everyday tasks. \n              Follow Us\n            ","time":1525809091,"title":"Android P","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/www.blog.google\/products\/android\/android-p\/","label":9,"label_name":"tech"},{"by":"hackyio","descendants":11,"id":17024127,"kids":"[17027021, 17024722, 17025544]","score":11,"text":"In late 2016, whilst leading the Developer Platform team at Intercom, I published a blog post titled \u201cBrowsers, not apps, are the future of mobile.\u201d It quickly became the most-read post published on Inside Intercom that year, and generated a lot of debate\u200a\u2014\u200aexternally on Hacker News and Medium, and internally within Intercom. At one point I was summonsed to the Inside Intercom podcast to explain myself. For some people, I had hit a nerve. So, 18 months later, what\u2019s changed? Are native apps dead yet? Are browsers and the web still the future of mobile? What is a browser, anyway? Let\u2019s dig in. The main argument of the post was this: browsers and the web are fast becoming the mobile operating system of the future, and native mobile apps are dying. There were three theories core to the argument, each of which i\u2019ll revisit and reexamine here. Recent mobile infrastructure, standards, and product development trends are fast making this theory a reality for most internet businesses. Granted, native apps are still useful for services like messengers and social networks\u200a\u2014\u200aall of which demand hours of user time daily (more on those types of apps later). For everything else, though, native apps are bloated and unnecessary. Networks like Verizon have confirmed their ambition to launch 5G broadband before the end of 2018. A battle between Samsung, Ericsson, Nokia and Huawei to become the 5G infrastructure provider of choice is also hotting up. Native apps were useful at a time when spotty 2G connections meant our smartphones were in offline mode most of the day. 5G is slated to be about 10 times faster than 4G, with less latency to boot\u200a\u2014\u200athe \u2018pipes\u2019 are in place to enable fast and immediate streaming of immersive and responsive experiences through the browser. No need for native apps. Standards have evolved quickly too, in favor of the mobile web. Fast-following Chrome and ChromeOS, Microsoft launched Progressive Web Apps to Microsoft Edge and the half a billion devices running Windows 10. This is a huge leap towards adoption of browser based progressive mobile web apps, particularly for enterprise users. And, hidden in the release notes of Safari 11.1 on iOS 11.3, was the addition of Service Workers and Payments APIs, key elements of progressive web apps. Apple still rely on Native apps sold through their App Store to bolster revenues, hence the lack of fanfare about this update. But developers now have a viable web based alternative to native apps. Realising that native apps are good for some things, but not all things, businesses are allocating resources to progressive web apps over iOS or Android apps. Platforms like Mobify are helping retailers like Debenhams, Crocs, and Lancome to make the transition. The frictionless mobile web experience (no native app download required) gave Lancome a 17% lift in mobile revenue, whilst Debenhams reported double digit increases in mobile revenues within weeks of launching their progressive web app. Money talks, and there\u2019s more of it to be made on the mobile web if you\u2019re an ecommerce business. Key to this theory is an evolving definition of what a \u2018browser\u2019 is. We\u2019re still spending increasing amounts of time inside messaging apps and social networks, themselves wrappers for the mobile web. They\u2019re new types of browsers, bringing social context and connections into the experience, something traditional browsers lack. And, in markets like India and China, these social networks and messengers are main way new internet users discover content on the web. The lines that divide traditional browsers, social networks, and messengers are blurring quickly. Mary Meeker\u2019s excellent KPCP 2017 Internet Trends report highlights just how blurry those lines have become. The slide below on China tells some interesting stories. Aside from Tencent now dominating the market over incumbents Alibaba and Baidu, messaging apps like WeChat (Tencent) are directly compared to \u2018traditional\u2019 browsers like UC Browser (Alibaba). In China, legacy categorisations like \u2018social network\u2019 or \u2018browser\u2019 don\u2019t matter. What matters are the tools that enable users to create, consume, and share information with each other, and the usage of those tools. On mobile, traditional browsers are but one of these tools. These slides on India tell a similar story, even if it\u2019s not immediately apparent. One one hand, \u2018Mobile Browser Usage Market Share\u2019 only includes traditional browsers like UC Browser, Opera, and Chrome. Messengers and social networks are nowhere to be seen. The full story becomes clear one slide later. Of the Top 10 Downloaded Android Apps, UC Browser appears just 6th in the list, far behind WhatApp and Facebook Messenger in 1st and 2nd place\u200a\u2014\u200aboth comparable products to WeChat in China. Let\u2019s not forget that UC Browser was mentioned as the market leading mobile browser in the previous slide. This is not accurate. Users in India are primarily creating, consuming and sharing information through messengers, not through traditional browsers. It\u2019s time to rethink our definition of what a browser is. Why do we use social networks and messengers? In part, to discover relevant information based on friend recommendations and to ask businesses for product recommendations. The information shared back to us includes links to pages on the internet. This is browsing the web, just a more modern and personalised way of doing it. This is the idea that bots are new type of intelligent, dynamic bookmark for mobile web browsers. Based on previous messenger interactions, bots push us relevant content, with improved relevancy over time. Like a social network feed, but based on your interactions only\u200a\u2014\u200anot those of your friends. For the most part, this has come to pass. Pinterest acknowledged the value of this new way to browse the internet through their bot, which recommends new pins based on users\u2019 previous requests and interactions. AI curation bots like Neil take this idea one step further, by using like, dislike, and bookmark additions as signals to improve the relevancy of recommendations. In Mexico, airline Aeromexico leveraged the power of Facebook Messenger bots to provide destination inspiration to customers, help them book flights, and guide them to knowledge base content to address frequently asked questions. And Tommy Hilfiger took the ecommerce browsing experience to Messenger through their \u201cSee now, buy now\u201d bot, which allows customers to purchase items featured on a virtual runway. Just two of the 300,000 active bots available on Facebook\u2019s Messenger platform. The evolution of the internet has come full circle. Whereas the world wide web started out as a collection of connected sources of information, native mobile apps siloed that information again, adding friction to our experience. Progressive web apps, and improved 5G connectivity are set to break those silos, reinstating the web as the most popular mobile operating system in the world\u200a\u2014\u200anot iOS or Android. For developers and start ups, this means a dedicating more focus to mobile web technologies, from progressive web apps, to new ways of delivering those apps closer to users and their mobile devices. New tools like Netlify have made this easier and cheaper than ever. It also means valuable time is spent creating new value\u200a\u2014\u200anot reinventing the wheel across multiple operating systems. And where do distribution opportunities exist\u200a\u2014\u200anot just in China and India, but globally? The biggest opportunities are still in consumer social and messaging apps, the new mobile browsers for an increasingly bot-enabled world. Originally published at www.developerecosystem.com.

Would it know my potato was a potato despite the penis-like protuberance that had earned the tuber its nickname? I asked the system to look at several different shots of my penis potato\u200a\u2014\u200awith flash and without, indoor and outdoor and at a variety of angles\u200a\u2014\u200aand obtained answers that ranged from \u2018butternut squash\u2019 to \u2018dough,\u2019 even when I shot the potato in such a way that its private parts were demurely hidden. What I didn\u2019t know at the time was that the system would never identify my potato as a potato, not because of its penis, but because it did not know about potatoes at all. The AI I was using is famous in certain circles and performed remarkably well in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) a few years back. For those unfamiliar with this contest, I\u2019d compare it to the Kentucky Derby, well known and equally exciting to those interested in horses and racing. The AI is called VGG-19, and ImageNet, the image data set used to train and test it, is famous in its own right, providing thousands of labeled images that researchers can use. As of now, according the site, ImageNet contains over fourteen million images for over 21,000 categories of things; however, only 1000 of these categories are used in the competition\u200a\u2014\u200a1000 synsets, as they are called, of which \u2018potato\u2019 is not one. In other words, because the AI had been trained on the ILSVRC contest data set, no matter how often I showed the system a potato or how perfect that potato\u2019s form, the system would never come up with the word \u2018potato\u2019 because it had not been taught to identify it. Potato is not one of the 1000. I took a look at the 1000 categories and learned that the AI ought to be able to identify a brassiere, a rifle, a feather boa, lotion, a manhole cover, a computer mouse, a pinwheel, a prayer rug, a whiskey jug. Mostly, as I looked through the list of the chosen, I wondered, why these? A paper on the contest explains that the 1000 contest categories were chosen randomly in 2010, the first year of the contest, and then curated to ensure they were not too obscure and that there was no overlap between any two categories in the hierarchy (if \u2018hound\u2019 is included, then \u2018hunting dog\u2019 (superclass) or \u2018beagle\u2019 (subclass) is not. Over the years, the set has changed, but 639 of the categories have been used in every challenge (through 2015, at least, the year the paper was published). In other words, I had randomness to thank for why the model could identify a brassiere, but not a painting, a pomegranate, but not a kiwi, a mashed potato, not my potato, a bookshop, but not a book. Wait\u2026 no books? I showed the AI a couple photographs of a book and I was told that it was an \u2018eraser\u2019 or \u2018envelope\u2019, or sometimes, more eerily, something that was in the photograph but that I hadn\u2019t really noticed at all. When I showed the AI a woman holding a stack of books, for example, it classified the photograph as a \u2018jersey\u2019. In another photograph, the AI looked right past the man reading, but identified the shelves of books in the background as a bookshop. The thing the AI predicts most confidently is not incorrect, it\u2019s just not necessarily where my eye is drawn when I look at the photo. To be clear, I do not expect the AI to see something it does not know about, and yet it is interesting to think about what we are teaching our technologies and what they are blind to because we have not shown them examples. I was able to spy on the AI to see where it looked thanks to the work of researchers at Virginia Tech and Georgia Institute of Technology, who built Guided Grad-CAM, which I used to generate the illustrations above. The Guided Grad-CAM technology has a number of interesting applications, but the one that struck me most was identifying bias based on the direction of the AI\u2019s gaze. In the example below, the biased model notices a female face and identifies her as a nurse. The biased model learned its bias from the data it was trained on, the researchers write, but using \u201cthe insights gained from the Grad-CAM visualizations, we balanced the dataset and retrained the model.\u201d The unbiased model looks at the stethoscope instead of the face when it determines the profession. In another thought-provoking study, researchers at Facebook looked at how well our technologies are doing at classifying objects, and where they are failing, with a special look at basketballs and the images used to illustrate them in ImageNet. Though the percentage of images they looked at in which at least one white or one black person appear is very similar (55% for the former, 53% for the latter), a model trained on this data behaves in an unexpected way. When asked to make predictions on a set of images selected so that \u2018the primary apparent difference between the two images is the skin color of the persons\u2019, the model demonstrates this pattern: \u201cAll images containing a black person are classified as basketball while similar photos with persons of different skin color are labeled differently\u201d (as a Volleyball, ping-pong ball, or baseball player, for example). In other words, the model has learned a bias. The researchers note: The reasons why the model learns these biases are unclear. One hypothesis is that despite the balanced distribution of races in pictures labeled basketball, blacks persons are more represented in this class in comparison to the other classes. I read the above passage a few times and thought about the implications. Who exactly is represented in ImageNet and who is not, I wondered. And what patterns are our technologies picking up simply because of who and what is included (or omitted) in the data? Our models are great at identifying patterns, only some of these patterns are not intended, or worse, harmful. Unsettling decisions by algorithms have appeared in the world of beauty contests, facial recognition, and natural language processing, among other areas. Last year, researchers found significant gender bias in several of our large image data sets. AIs trained on these images have not only picked up on but amplified these biases, associating women with things like kitchens and men with sporting goods (see the story in Wired). I appreciate the tremendous efforts that goes into creating and maintaining the image data sets that we rely on to train and test our AIs. Without ImageNet and the competition around it, I do not think our technologies would have evolved as rapidly. Still, I have not come across a study relating to skin color and representation in this data set, and I am concerned about what it means to associate human skin tones with some types of things and not others. Repeatedly, I hear image data called \u2018real world data\u2019. But do the data reflect reality? And how can we make sure that the data are not simply reinforcing the biases that we as a society must strive to conquer as well? * * * Further reading: \u201cGrad-CAM: Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-based Localization,\u201d Ramprasaath R.

In our announcement over at the Google Developer site, we provide a broader overview of the Flutter project and showcase some examples of how customers are using it to create amazing applications. In this blog post, we\u2019ll take a deeper look at the specific improvements we\u2019ve made in Beta 3 itself. As mentioned when we shipped our first beta at Mobile World Congress in February, our intent is to continue to ship releases that are at least of beta quality on approximately a monthly cadence. This release (v0.3.2) is the third release in that lineage, and demonstrates continued progress towards completing the 1.0 release. Our work in this release has focused on three primary areas: fundamentals, ecosystem and tooling. Let\u2019s start with the fundamentals, where we\u2019ve improved the built-in UI widgets, completed the remaining feature work for Dart 2, and introduced a new embedding API. In Flutter Beta 3, we\u2019ve made a number of improvements to the Material Design widgets to enable greater flexibility and customization. For example: Additionally, we\u2019ve added support for animated resources in formats like GIF and WebP, ready for your best meme apps to be published to the app stores! We also made a number of updates to the Flutter Gallery application to demonstrate these and other changes. For example: We\u2019ve completed the work to enable Dart 2, our reboot of the Dart language that is optimized for client development. As of this release, Dart 2 is feature complete and enabled by default. In this release, Dart 2 adds some syntactic sugar to help with instantiating widgets in Flutter. The new keyword is now entirely optional: there should be no need to use it any longer, and it\u2019s a bug if the compiler complains. A build() method like this is easier than ever to write: The const keyword becomes optional for any child constructors within an existing const scope. During the first two betas, we identified scenarios where it was difficult to infer from the context whether an object\u2019s children are immutable, so we require the const keyword at the top level to make the constant nature of the code explicit. Once you\u2019ve declared a section as const, however, the children are automatically const without requiring further declaration, so now a statement like the following is valid: In other areas, we\u2019ve made improvements to the accessibility support for apps that use Flutter, including improving support for screen readers, large text and contrast capabilities, as well as starting to document our accessibility support. We\u2019re also ready for apps that are offered in languages with right-to-left scripts. In addition to supporting right-to-left text, controls mirror where appropriate (for example the left \u2018back\u2019 button has inverted direction and justification in languages like Arabic). We\u2019ve also rewritten the Flutter engine\u2019s threading model to make it possible to host multiple FlutterViews within a single application. This is part of our larger focus on making it easier to add Flutter to your existing app\u200a\u2014\u200awork that continues in progress. We launched an initial suite of Firebase plugins at Google I\/O last year. Several of those plugins are reaching their 1.0 milestone this week: Realtime Database, Firebase Analytics, Firebase Messaging, and Firebase Core. In addition, we have added new, fully-featured plugins for Remote Config, Cloud Firestore, and Performance Monitoring. For an overview of our Firebase support, please see the FlutterFire page. Our support for ads powered by AdMob by Google is graduating to beta, enabling you to monetize your Flutter-based applications. The AdMob plugin supports loading and displaying banner, interstitial (full-screen), and rewarded video ads using the AdMob API. There are many other packages that have recently been made available for Flutter, some contributed by the Flutter team directly, others by community members. As mentioned in our I\/O announcement post, Flutter is a first-class toolkit for Material, which means the Material and Flutter teams have partnered to deliver even more support for Material Design. We continue to release regular updates to the Flutter plugin for Android Studio and IntelliJ to improve the development experience. In particular, we\u2019ve redesigned the UI Inspector with a new \u201cJust My Widgets\u201d feature that filters out auto-generated widgets. You can also run your Flutter app in profile mode, which adds frames-per-second and memory usage displays. Visual Studio Code is now considered a fully-supported development environment for Flutter, in addition to the Android Studio support mentioned above. Flutter support is enabled through the Flutter extension, available through the Visual Studio Marketplace. The latest version of our Visual Studio Code extension supports Flutter Beta 3 features including Dart 2, and the changelog is here. Other notable features in this release for both Android Studio and Visual Studio Code include a broader set of refactorings. This includes an Extract Widget refactor that creates a new Widget class and inserts a call to its constructor in the original position: There are a few ways to get in touch with us and find out what\u2019s going on with Flutter.

One nifty twist here is that these models \u2014 which support text recognition, face detection, barcode scanning, image labeling and landmark recognition \u2014 are available both online and offline, depending on network availability and the developer\u2019s preference. In the coming months, Google plans to extend the current base set of available APIs with two more: one for integrating the same kind of smart replies that you\u2019re probably familiar with from apps like Inbox and Gmail, and a high-density face contour feature for the face detection API. The real game-changer here are the offline models that developers can integrate into their apps and that they can use for free. Unsurprisingly, there is a trade-off here. The models that run on the device are smaller and hence offer a lower level of accuracy. In the cloud, neither model size nor available compute power are an issue, so those models are larger and hence more accurate, too. That\u2019s pretty much standard for the industry. Earlier this year, Microsoft launched its offline neural translations, for example, which can also either run online or on the device. The trade-off there is the same. Brahim Elbouchikhi, Google\u2019s group product manager for machine intelligence and the camera lead for Android, told me that a lot of developers will likely do some of the preliminary machine learning inference on the device, maybe to see if there is actually an animal in a picture, and then move to the cloud to detect what breed of dog it actually is. And that makes sense, because the on-device image labeling service features about 400 labels, while the cloud-based one features more than 10,000. To power the on-device models, ML Kit uses the standard Neural Networks API on Android and its equivalent on Apple\u2019s iOS. He also stressed that this is very much a cross-platform product. Developers don\u2019t think of machine learning models as Android- or iOS-specific, after all. For developers who want to go beyond the pre-trained models, ML Kit also supports TensorFlow Lite models.  As Google rightly notes, getting up to speed with using machine learning isn\u2019t for the faint of heart. This new SDK, which falls under Google\u2019s Firebase  brand, is clearly meant to make using machine learning easier for mobile developers. While Google Cloud already offers a number of similar pre-trained and customizable machine learning APIs, those don\u2019t work offline, and the experience isn\u2019t integrated tightly with Firebase and the Firebase Console either, which is quickly becoming Google\u2019s go-to hub for all things mobile development. Even for custom TensorFlow Lite models, Google is working on compressing the models to a more workable size. For now, this is only an experiment, but developers who want to give it a try can sign up here. Overall,\u00a0Elbouchikhi\u00a0argues, the work here is about democratizing machine learning. \u201cOur goal is to make machine learning just another tool,\u201d he said.

For the second offense in that kind, whereof any shall be legally convicted, shall pay the sum of twenty shillings, or be whipped upon the naked body, not exceeding ten stripes. And for the third offense forty shillings, or if the party be unable to pay, then to be whipped with more stripes, not exceeding fifteen. \u201c For a fourth offense, the punishment was 10 shillings more than formerly, or if unable to pay, then 5-6 more stripes than formerly, not exceeding 40. [Bold letters are\u00a0 mine.] This law was included in the Massachusetts Bay Colony\u2019s first printed compilation of statutes\u00a0The Book of the General Lawes and Libertyes Concerning the Inhabitants of Massachusetts\u00a0(1648). Facsimiles of this book\u00a0are owned by the\u00a0Massachusetts Trial Court Law Libraries. One can also read selections of this book online at Le Projet Albion\/Puritan Studies on the Web\/Primary Sources.\u00a0\u00a0(see # 35) \u00a0 The Puritan-dominated Colony clearly hoped to instill Christian values in the community, and protect the vulnerable young colony from danger, by threatening to punish all lying, not only those lies that damaged\u00a0 a particular individual, but also any lies that were simply \u201cpernicious to the publick weal\u201d. (Plymouth Colony passed its own law against spreading false news in 1653, with very similar wording; Virginia followed in 1661; Maryland in 1671; New York in 1664; Pennsylvania in 1682; and South Carolina in 1691.) If someone lied about a particular individual, that individual could sue for slander, which was often done; but the liar could also face criminal sanctions, especially if the person lied about an important government or church official. \u00a0This had been typical in English common law for centuries. \u00a0The impetus was to protect the reputations of important men, because the stability of the government depended upon their good relations with each other (and with the crown) and the nation\u2019s trust in their integrity.\u00a0 That was, in essence, the old conception of \u201cfalse news\u201d. The new conception of \u201cfalse news\u201d, which arose in the seventeenth century, had to do with events rather than particular people.\u00a0 If one lied about a supposed event, especially in a way that endangered the public good, one could face the criminal charge of lying and spreading \u201cfalse news and reports\u201d. Lying often accompanies other crimes, so it is sometimes difficult to separate the crime of lying from other charges an individual might face simultaneously, as for example, when someone were charged with both lying and theft, lying and blasphemy, or lying in order to entrap a young woman so as to pander her. EXAMPLES of people in colonial Massachusetts convicted and punished for lying alone include the following. In 1678, Nicholas Shapleigh and Richard Naggs, mariners on a ship, were fined 10 shillings apiece for their\u00a0 \u201cpernicious lie to ye \u00a0country\u201d, for claiming that there was French contraband and brandy on a ship, and then denying their lie in court, saying it was just \u201cthe slip of the pen\u201d. \u00a0In this apparently civil case, the plaintiff was their captain Andrew Craty; they agreed to give him their wages as libel, so he withdrew his case.\u00a0 But the court fined them for lying to the court about it. In 1682, James Fuller of Springfield claimed that he had prayed to the Devil for help, and was familiar with the Devil on several occasions; in court he admitted that he had lied about this; he was found not guilty by a jury for witchcraft, but the Court, \u201cconsidering his wicked and pernicious willful lying and continuance in it till now putting the country to so great a charge\u201d sentenced him to be whipped 30 stripes and fined 5 pounds. In 1691, Josiah Littlefield (bound over to the General Court in Boston from the County Court of Salem) \u00a0was convicted of lying for reporting that he knew men who had had sold powder and shot to the Indians; he denied it in court; he was fined 10 shillings and fees of Court. [Records of the Court of Assistants of the Colony of the Massachusetts Bay 1630-1692, (1901). Vol 1, p. 147, 228, & 356 respectively.] \u00a0 Today, the Massachusetts General Laws have no proscription against spreading false news, except as it relates to libel and slander of particular individuals.\u00a0 (Slander is oral defamation, libel is written.)

It can feel impossible to keep up with the hundreds of thousands of tweets, tens of thousands of pages, and hundreds of hours of video that come online every single minute. Amid this deluge of information, important new voices are constantly emerging. There\u2019s more diverse content to discover and more great journalism being produced than ever before. In order to make it easier to keep up and make sense of it all, we\u00a0set out to bring our news products into one unified experience.\u00a0\u00a0 Today we\u2019re rolling out an all new Google News, which uses the best of artificial intelligence to find the best of human intelligence\u2014the great reporting done by journalists around the globe.  When we created the original Google News 15 years ago, we simply organized news articles to make it easier to see a range of sources on the same topic.\u00a0\u00a0 The reimagined Google News uses a new set of AI techniques to take a constant flow of information as it hits the web, analyze it in real time and organize it into storylines. This approach means Google News understands the people, places and things involved in a story as it evolves, and connects how they relate to one another. At its core, this technology lets us synthesize information and put it together in a way that helps you make sense of what\u2019s happening, and what the impact or reaction has been.  For many of us, news comes from dozens of different places\u2014sports from a favorite website, politics from TV, and news about your community from your local paper. When you\u2019re in the app, \u201cFor You\u201d makes it easy to stay up to date on everything you care about all in one place. We start with a briefing of five stories that Google News has organized for you\u2014a mix of the most important headlines, local news and the latest developments on the topics you\u2019re interested in. \u00a0 And the more you use the app, the better the app gets. We\u2019ve also built easy-to-use and easy-to-access controls so you can decide if you want to see more or less of a topic or publisher. As we built the app, we focused on letting the stories speak for themselves with great images and videos from YouTube and across the web. To help you quickly get you up to speed, we\u2019re experimenting with a unique visual format called newscasts. Here, the latest developments in natural language understanding bring together a collection of articles, videos and quotes on a single topic. Newscasts make it easy to dive right into perspectives to learn more about a story\u2014plus, it\u2019s easy to read on your phone.  If you want to get a deeper insight into a story, the \u201cFull Coverage\u201d feature provides a complete picture of how that story is reported from a variety of sources. With just a tap you\u2019ll see top headlines from different sources, videos, local news reports, FAQs, social commentary, and a timeline for stories that have played out over time. Having a productive conversation or debate requires everyone to have access to the same information. That\u2019s why content in Full Coverage is the same for everyone\u2014it\u2019s an unpersonalized view of events from a range of trusted news sources. To find out what the world is reading, head over to Headlines for an unfiltered view of news from around the world. Additional sections let you dig into more on technology, business, sports, entertainment and others.  Of course Google News wouldn\u2019t exist without the great journalism being created every day. The Newsstand tab makes it easy to find and follow the sources you trust, as well as browse and discover new ones.

This means that Notepad was unable to correctly display the contents of text files created in Unix, Linux and macOS. For example, here\u2019s a screenshot of Notepad trying to display the contents of a Linux .bashrc text file, which only contains Unix LF EOL characters:  As you can see, Notepad is incorrectly displaying the file\u2019s contents, making the file look garbled. This has been a major annoyance for developers, IT Pros, administrators, and end users throughout the community. Today, we\u2019re excited to announce that we have fixed this issue! Starting with the current Windows 10 Insider build, Notepad will support Unix\/Linux line endings (LF), Macintosh line endings (CR), and Windows Line endings (CRLF) as usual. New files created within Notepad will use Windows line ending (CRLF) by default, but it will now be possible to view, edit, and print existing files, correctly maintaining the file\u2019s current line ending format. Here\u2019s a screenshot of the newly updated Notepad displaying the contents of the same Unix\/Linux .bashrc file we saw earlier:  Also note that the status bar indicates the detected EOL format of the currently open file. As with any change to a long-established tool, there\u2019s a chance that this new behavior may not work for your scenarios, or you may prefer to disable this new behavior and return to Notepad\u2019s original behavior.

But the extent to which transhumanists take the concept is. In the past, we made devices such as wooden legs, hearing aids, spectacles and false teeth. In future, we might use implants to augment our senses so we can detect infrared or ultraviolet radiation directly or boost our cognitive processes by connecting ourselves to memory chips. Ultimately, by merging man and machine, science will produce humans who have vastly increased intelligence, strength, and lifespans; a near embodiment of gods. Is that a desirable goal? Advocates of transhumanism believe there are spectacular rewards to be reaped from going beyond the natural barriers and limitations that constitute an ordinary human being. But to do so would raise a host of ethical problems and dilemmas. As O\u2019Connell\u2019s book indicates, the ambitions of transhumanism are now rising up our intellectual agenda. But this is a debate that is only just beginning. There is no doubt that human enhancement is becoming more and more sophisticated \u2013 as will be demonstrated at the exhibition The Future Starts Here which opens at the V&A museum in London this week. Items on display will include \u201cpowered clothing\u201d made by the US company Seismic. Worn under regular clothes, these suits mimic the biomechanics of the human body and give users \u2013 typically older people \u2013 discrete strength when getting out of a chair or climbing stairs, or standing for long periods. In many cases these technological or medical advances are made to help the injured, sick or elderly but are then adopted by the healthy or young to boost their lifestyle or performance. The drug erythropoietin (EPO) increases red blood cell production in patients with severe anaemia but has also been taken up as an illicit performance booster by some athletes to improve their bloodstream\u2019s ability to carry oxygen to their muscles. And that is just the start, say experts. \u201cWe are now approaching the time when, for some kinds of track sports such as the 100-metre sprint, athletes who run on carbon-fibre blades will be able outperform those who run on natural legs,\u201d says Blay Whitby, an artificial intelligence expert at Sussex University. The question is: when the technology reaches this level, will it be ethical to allow surgeons to replace someone\u2019s limbs with carbon-fibre blades just so they can win gold medals? Whitby is sure many athletes will seek such surgery. \u201cHowever, if such an operation came before any ethics committee that I was involved with, I would have none of it. It is a repulsive idea \u2013 to remove a healthy limb for transient gain.\u201d Not everyone in the field agrees with this view, however. Cybernetics expert Kevin Warwick, of Coventry University, sees no problem in approving the removal of natural limbs and their replacement with artificial blades. \u201cWhat is wrong with replacing imperfect bits of your body with artificial parts that will allow you to perform better \u2013 or which might allow you to live longer?\u201d he says. Warwick is a cybernetics enthusiast who, over the years, has had several different electronic devices implanted into his body. \u201cOne allowed me to experience ultrasonic inputs. It gave me a bat sense, as it were. I also interfaced my nervous system with my computer so that I could control a robot hand and experience what it was touching. I did that when I was in New York, but the hand was in a lab in England.\u201d Such interventions enhance the human condition, Warwick insists, and indicate the kind of future humans might have when technology augments performance and the senses. Some might consider this unethical. But even doubters such as Whitby acknowledge the issues are complex. \u201cIs it ethical to take two girls under the age of five and train them to play tennis every day of their lives until they have the musculature and skeletons of world champions?\u201d he asks. From this perspective the use of implants or drugs to achieve the same goal does not look so deplorable. This last point is a particular issue for those concerned with the transhumanist movement. They believe that modern technology ultimately offers humans the chance to live for aeons, unshackled \u2013 as they would be \u2013 from the frailties of the human body. Failing organs would be replaced by longer-lasting high-tech versions just as carbon-fibre blades could replace the flesh, blood and bone of natural limbs. Thus we would end humanity\u2019s reliance on \u201cour frail version 1.0 human bodies into a far more durable and capable 2.0 counterpart,\u201d as one group has put it. However, the technology needed to achieve these goals relies on as yet unrealised developments in genetic engineering, nanotechnology and many other sciences and may take many decades to reach fruition. As a result, many advocates \u2013 such as the US inventor and entrepreneur Ray Kurzweil, nanotechnology pioneer Eric Drexler and PayPal founder and venture capitalist Peter Thiel have backed the idea of having their bodies stored in liquid nitrogen and cryogenically preserved until medical science has reached the stage when they can be revived and their resurrected bodies augmented and enhanced. Four such cryogenic facilities have now been constructed: three in the US and one in Russia. The largest is the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Arizona whose refrigerators store more than 100 bodies (nevertheless referred to as \u201cpatients\u201d by staff) in the hope of their subsequent thawing and physiological resurrection. It is \u201ca place built to house the corpses of optimists\u201d, as O\u2019Connell says in To Be a Machine. Not everyone is convinced about the feasibility of such technology or about its desirability. \u201cI was once interviewed by a group of cryonic enthusiasts \u2013 based in California \u2013 called the society for the abolition of involuntary death,\u201d recalls the Astronomer Royal Martin Rees. \u201cI told them I\u2019d rather end my days in an English churchyard than a Californian refrigerator. They derided me as a deathist \u2013 really old-fashioned.\u201d For his part, Rees believes that those who choose to freeze themselves in the hope of being eventually thawed out would be burdening future generations expected to care for these newly defrosted individuals. \u201cIt is not clear how much consideration they would deserve,\u201d Rees adds. Ultimately, adherents of transhumanism envisage a day when humans will free themselves of all corporeal restraints. Kurzweil and his followers believe this turning point will be reached around the year 2030, when biotechnology will enable a union between humans and genuinely intelligent computers and AI systems. The resulting human-machine mind will become free to roam a universe of its own creation, uploading itself at will on to a \u201csuitably powerful computational substrate\u201d. We will become gods, or more likely \u201cstar children\u201d similar to the one at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey. These are remote and, for many people, very fanciful goals. And the fact that much of the impetus for establishing such extreme forms of transhuman technology comes from California and Silicon Valley is not lost on critics. Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, the entrepreneur who wants to send the human race to Mars, also believes that to avoid becoming redundant in the face of the development of artificial intelligence, humans must merge with machines to enhance our own intellect. This is a part of the world where the culture of youth is followed with fanatical intensity and where ageing is feared more acutely than anywhere else on the planet. Hence the overpowering urge to try to use technology to overcome its effects. It is also one of the world\u2019s richest regions, and many of those who question the values of the transhuman movement warn it risks creating technologies that will only create deeper gulfs in an already divided society where only some people will be able to afford to become enhanced while many other lose out. The position is summed up by Whitby. \u201cHistory is littered with the evil consequences of one group of humans believing they are superior to another group of humans,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately in the case of enhanced humans they will be genuinely superior. We need to think about the implications before it is too late.\u201d For their part, transhumanists argue that the costs of enhancement will inevitably plummet and point to the example of the mobile phone, which was once so expensive only the very richest could afford one, but which today is a universal gadget owned by virtually every member of society. Such ubiquity will become a feature of technologies for augmenting men and women, advocates insist. Many of these issues seem remote, but experts warn that the implications involved need to be debated as a matter of urgency. An example is provided by the artificial hand being developed by Newcastle University. Current prosthetic limbs are limited by their speed of response. But project leader Kianoush Nazarpour believes it will soon be possible to create bionic hands that can assess an object and instantly decide what kind of grip it should adopt. \u201cIt will be of enormous benefit, but its use raises all sorts of issues. Who will own it: the wearer or the NHS? And if it is used to carry a crime, who ultimately will be responsible for its control? We are not thinking about these concerns and that is a worry.\u201d The position is summed up by bioethicist professor Andy Miah of Salford University. \u201cTranshumanism is valuable and interesting philosophically because it gets us to think differently about the range of things that humans might be able to do \u2013 but also because it gets us to think critically about some of those limitations that we think are there but can in fact be overcome,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are talking about the future of our species, after all.\u201d LimbsThe artificial limbs of Luke Skywalker and the Six Million Dollar Man are works of fiction. In reality, bionic limbs have suffered from multiple problems: becoming rigid mid-action, for example. But new generations of sensors are now making it possible for artificial legs and arms to behave in much more complex, human-like ways. SensesThe light that is visible to humans excludes both infrared and ultra-violet radiation. However, researchers are working on ways of extending the wavelengths of radiation that we can detect, allowing us to see more of the world - and in a different light. Ideas like these are particularly popular with military researchers trying to create cyborg soldiers. PowerPowered suits or exoskeletons are wearable mobile machines that allow people to move their limbs with increased strength and endurance. Several versions are being developed by the US army, while medical researchers are working on easy-to-wear versions that would be able to help people with severe medical conditions or who have lost limbs to move about naturally. BrainsTranshumanists envisage the day when memory chips and neural pathways are actually embedded into people\u2019s brains, thus bypassing the need to use external devices such as computers in order to access data and to make complicated calculations. The line between humanity and machines will become increasingly blurred.","time":1525797101,"title":"No death and an enhanced life: Is the future transhuman?","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2018\/may\/06\/no-death-and-an-enhanced-life-is-the-future-transhuman","label":5,"label_name":"ml"},{"by":"jonbaer","descendants":120,"id":17022215,"kids":"[17023703, 17022985, 17022535, 17026503, 17022907, 17022595, 17027119, 17022586, 17022923, 17023185, 17022736, 17024376, 17025486, 17024126, 17028619, 17023566, 17026129, 17024208, 17026156, 17023122, 17023005, 17029995, 17029044, 17024642, 17025136, 17022984, 17023976, 17029734, 17024249]","score":271,"text":"\n        Edmon de Haro for BuzzFeed News\n       \n          \n          A vast web of Amazon review fraud lives online, and it's designed to evade the company\u2019s efforts to thwart it.\n         One morning in late January, Jake picked up the box on his desk, tore through the packing tape, unearthed the iPhone case inside, snapped a picture, and uploaded it to an Amazon review he\u2019d been writing. The review included a sentence about the case\u2019s sleek design and cool, clear volume buttons. He finished off the blurb with a glowing title (\u201cThe perfect case!!\u201d) and rated the product a perfect five stars. Click. Submitted. Jake never tried the case. He doesn\u2019t even have an iPhone. Jake then copied the link to his review and pasted it into an invite-only Slack channel for paid Amazon reviewers. A day later, he received a notification from PayPal, alerting him to a new credit in his account: a $10 refund for the phone case he\u2019ll never use, along with $3 for his trouble \u2014 potentially more, if he can resell the iPhone case. Jake is not his real name. He \u2014 along with the four other reviewers who spoke to BuzzFeed News for this story \u2014 wanted to remain anonymous for fear Amazon would ban their accounts. They are part of an extensive, invisible workforce fueling a review-fraud economy that persists in every corner of the largest marketplace on the internet. Drawn in by easy money and free stuff, they\u2019ve seeded Amazon with fake five-star reviews of LED lights, dog bowls, clothing, and even health items like prenatal vitamins \u2014 all meant to convince you that this product is the best and bolster the sales of profiteers hoping to grab a piece of the Amazon Gold Rush. Meanwhile, sellers trying to play by the rules are struggling to stay afloat amid a sea of fraudulent reviews, and buyers are unwittingly purchasing inferior or downright faulty products. And Amazon is all but powerless to stop it. The systems that create fraudulent reviews are a complicated web of subreddits, invite-only Slack channels, private Discord servers, and closed Facebook groups, but the incentives are simple: Being a five-star product is crucial to selling inventory at scale in Amazon\u2019s intensely competitive marketplace \u2014 so crucial that merchants are willing to pay thousands of people to review their products positively. At just over $760 billion, Amazon is the world\u2019s second most valuable company, behind Apple. CEO Jeff Bezos recently revealed the company counts more than 100 million paying Amazon Prime members globally, the $119-per-year membership that gets subscribers \u2014 the most devoted Amazon customers \u2014 free two-day shipping; music, TV, and movie streaming; access to an e-book library; and more. The company operates 13 third-party seller marketplaces around the world, and rents space to house those sellers\u2019 inventory in more than 150 warehouses. In 2017, third-party merchants brought in $32 billion of revenue, and nearly 300,000 new sellers joined the marketplace last year alone. Reviews are a buyer\u2019s best chance to navigate this dizzyingly crowded market and a seller\u2019s chance to stand out from the crowd. In a 2011 survey, 87% of consumers said a positive review confirmed their decision to purchase a product; online customer reviews are the second most trusted source of product information, behind recommendations from family and friends. But only 3% to 10% of customers leave reviews. The best way to make it on Amazon is with positive reviews, and the best way to get positive reviews is to buy them. In October 2016, Amazon banned free items or steep discounts in exchange for reviews facilitated by third parties. But Tommy Noonan, CEO of ReviewMeta, a site that analyzes Amazon listings, said what he calls \u201cunnatural reviews\u201d \u2014 that is, reviews, that his algorithm indicates might be fake \u2014 have returned to the platform. In June 2017, Noonan noticed an uptick in unnatural reviews along with an increase in the average rating of products, and the rate of growth hasn\u2019t slowed since. Amazon\u2019s ban didn\u2019t stop sellers from recruiting reviewers. It only drove the practice underground. Reviewers are no longer simply incentivized with free stuff \u2014 they\u2019re commissioned specifically for a five-star rating in exchange for cash. The bad reviews are harder to spot, too: They don\u2019t contain any disclosures (because incentivized reviews are banned, and a disclosure would indicate that the review violates Amazon\u2019s terms). Paid reviewers also typically pay for products with their own credit cards on their own Amazon accounts, with which they have spent at least $50, all to meet the criteria for a \u201cverified purchase,\u201d so their reviews are marked as such. Amazon won\u2019t reveal how many reviews \u2014 fraudulent or total \u2014 it has. But based on his analysis of Amazon data, Noonan estimates that Amazon hosts around 250 million reviews. Noonan's website has collected 58.5 million of those reviews, and the ReviewMeta algorithm labeled 9.1%, or 5.3 million of the dataset's reviews, as \u201cunnatural.\u201d The Amazon spokesperson initially told BuzzFeed News the percentage of inauthentic reviews on the platform is \u201ctiny,\u201d but would not be more specific. In an email sent after the article\u2019s publication, she wrote, \u201cInauthentic reviews made up less than 1% of all reviews on Amazon in March but even one is unacceptable.\u201d That percentage reflects reviews Amazon has identified as inauthentic, but does not capture fake reviews designed to evade Amazon\u2019s detection, as many are. Internal investigators also examine reviews and \u201cnon-Amazon forums\u201d used for purchasing reviews, the spokesperson said. Amazon says it blocks or suspends accounts belonging to any of the parties involved. The statement also included that \u201cAmazon is investing heavily to detect and prevent inauthentic reviews. In addition to advance detection, we use a machine-learned algorithm that gives more weight to newer, more helpful reviews, apply strict criteria to qualify for the Amazon verified purchase badge and enforce a significant dollar amount requirement to participate.\u201d But conversations with sellers, customers, and reviewers reveal that review abuse continues, despite the company\u2019s efforts. An unnatural review doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a product is inferior. But the problem with paid-for reviews is that they make it difficult for consumers \u2014 even savvy ones \u2014 to know if what they\u2019re buying is actually good or bad. In December, Kevin Votaw of Fort Collins, Colorado, ordered a highly rated Samsung Galaxy S8 screen protector for $10 using his girlfriend\u2019s Amazon Prime account. It was, he said, \u201cterrible\u201d: The material was so thick he couldn\u2019t type, making the product completely unusable. Frustrated, Votaw asked Amazon for a refund for the unreturnable product, which has a sticky, adhesive backing and can\u2019t be reused. \u201cI went back to the listing, thinking, \u2018Surely all of these reviews are wrong,\u2019\u201d he said. But the product was unavailable \u2014 \u201clike the company was rolling these protectors out in batches, then taking them off Amazon.\u201d Amazon removed the screen protector listing after a BuzzFeed News inquiry, but two other listings with nearly identical product photography have more than 550 and 150 reviews each, all of which include a five-star rating and are unverified. Votaw has since found a protector with a mediocre 3.5-star rating that he\u2019s happy with: \u201cIt works perfectly,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be leaving a great review.\u201d Type in \u201cAmazon Review\u201d into Facebook\u2019s search box, and more than a hundred groups will pop up. Two of the more popular groups, Amazon Review Club and US \u2014 Amazon Review Club, which had 69,000 and 60,000 members, respectively, were recently shut down, but many more groups remain, with tens of thousands of members apiece.  The groups\u2019 posts read like the most random garage sale ever: lawn aerator shoes, lint removers, diaper pads, sex toys. New products are posted every minute. Most sellers are Chinese; in February, group members were warned that lunar holidays might slow down payments. Posts include a photo of the product up for grabs, with a description that says, \u201cPP refund after review,\u201d which means interested parties will receive a PayPal payment after proof they\u2019ve published a review. One product listed in the group, a posture corrector designed to train your back to sit upright, was offering an unusually large commission: a $30 Amazon gift card that included $20 for the product and an extra $10 for the reviewer, who needed to be an Amazon Prime member and write a review that contained images. Meanwhile, the 36,629-member \/r\/slavelabour subreddit, which is dedicated to getting \u201cjobs done well below market rate,\u201d has a formalized process for posting opportunities for would-be Amazon reviewers. Redditors negotiate a fake review. Sellers post \u201ctasks\u201d that include leaving positive reviews on their products \u2014 or one-star reviews on competitors\u2019 products. One listing read, \u201cThe reviews don\u2019t need to be verified or anything, so the task won\u2019t take more than a minute of your time. I will send you the link to the product, you go and leave a brief 1 star review, and that\u2019s it. I will pay $5 to you through Paypal as soon as the review is live on Amazon.\u201d Within a week, 27 users had placed \u201cbids\u201d on the task, expressing their interest. The most active reviewers become headhunters, working to recruit \/r\/slavelabour users into private Discord servers or Slack channels dedicated solely to feeding the Amazon review ecosystem. Sellers typically pay between $4 to $5 per review, plus a refund of the product. Moderators take a cut off the top \u2014 around 20% to 25% for the Discord server I gained access to, but reviewers get to keep the item for free. On Jan. 13, the server\u2019s moderator published a call for reviewers interested in \u201cBefore You Go To The Toilet Poop Spray,\u201d a natural deodorizer carrying the \u201cscent of Australia\u201d by a company called Veil. The poop spray\u2019s listing shows a number of negative reviews, followed by a string of more positive reviews published after Jan. 13. Both positive and negative reviews are \u201cverified purchases,\u201d making it nearly impossible to differentiate between commissioned and genuine reviews. None of the reviews contain a disclosure that the product was received for free or that the review was paid for by the seller. In an email to BuzzFeed News, Greg Doney, a Veil Fragrances representative, acknowledged the company had paid for reviews, \u201cbut you have to as its [sic] really hard to launch a product without them.\u201d When you take a closer look at the poop spray customers\u2019 product review history, a pattern emerges. In addition to the poop spray, Amazon customers \u201cBrian\u201d and \u201cSharon\u201d also gave a floating shelf bracket, which had been posted to the Discord server earlier, high marks. Brian said the product was a \u201creally sturdy shelf\u201d (it\u2019s a bracket, not a stand-alone shelf); and Sharon noted they\u2019re \u201ceasy to mount\u201d and \u201cdurable.\u201d The critical reviews, meanwhile, warn customers \u201cDO NOT BUY!\u201d and \u201cHUGE waste of money,\u201d citing wall damage and poorly made brackets. (The shelf company did not respond to a request for comment sent to its Amazon seller profile from BuzzFeed News.) The same accounts also reviewed \u201cBoric Acid Suppositories\u201d for vaginal health. The supplements are intended to be inserted into the vagina twice daily for two weeks, according to the product\u2019s label. It purports to provide \u201cvaginal health support\u201d and \u201crelief from odor, itchiness, pain, burning, and soreness.\u201d The capsules were posted to the Discord server on Jan. 22 \u2014 and reviews from Brian and Sharon appeared shortly after that. Brian commented that his girlfriend was \u201chaving pain during sex and it was not because of me,\u201d and the supplements cured her. Sharon mentioned it was the \u201cbest and cheapest\u201d option for female hygiene and health. Neither of the reviews were marked as verified purchases. A five-star review by D. Pham even says the boric acid \u201cdoesn\u2019t taste bad\u201d even though the pill is not taken orally. (D. Pham also gave the floating shelf bracket five stars.) Meanwhile, a one-star review said that the product was a \u201cnightmare,\u201d citing how the pill \u201cfeels like a clump of cement mix in my vagina that is just gritty and totally dries it out.\u201d Another said the suppository caused \u201can irritating burning sensation that lasted for hours.\u201d The company did not respond to a request for comment. According to Dr. Jenny Jaque, assistant professor of gynecology at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine, boric acid suppositories should only be used under certain circumstances, under the supervision of a health care provider. \u201cBoric acid is not candy, and you need to be careful,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can cause irritation: Your vagina will hurt; you\u2019d feel pain like your vagina is on fire.\u201d She added that \u201cit is really toxic if ingested by accident.\u201d The Discord server recently posted turmeric curcumin vitamins, as well as myoinositol capsules, made by the same brand, listed in the prenatal vitamin category. The same reviewers \u2014 Sharon and D. Pham \u2014 gave the prenatal vitamins five stars. Both of their reviews were marked as verified purchases. The company did not respond to a request for comment. Amazon said it has applied stricter criteria for leaving verified purchase reviews. US reviewers must have a password-protected account and have made at least $50 in purchases on Amazon with a valid credit card. During a hot summer in 2010, Jamie Whaley discovered a problem with her fitted sheets: They were breaking loose and ending up wrapped around her husband Jimmy\u2019s ankles. Whaley, then a 40-year-old nursing student in Texas, went in search of a solution. The suspenderlike designs on older sheet fasteners were too cumbersome, so Whaley developed her own, using a shock cord to make an easy button-enabled tightening mechanism. She called her new invention BedBand. Jimmy Whaley convinced his wife to start selling BedBands on Amazon. The product worked, and people wanted to buy it: Over the next few years, BedBand became Amazon\u2019s best-selling sheet fastener, with more $700,000 in annual sales. Then, in October 2014, BedBand\u2019s revenue was suddenly cut in half to about $350,000. Whaley, who had given up a nursing career, and Jim, who had also joined the company full time as COO, were devastated. \u201cSomeone was selling an exact replica of our product, and we couldn\u2019t use our patent because it was pending,\u201d said Whaley. Counterfeits, sold in bulk on AliExpress, had flooded Amazon\u2019s sheet fastener market, and many gained dozens of five-star reviews very quickly. Over the next eight months, sales tanked. \u201cThere were tears,\u201d said Whaley. \u201cWe wondered whether it was time to look for different jobs.\u201d She was forced to lay off eight contractors, half her staff at the time. Amazon took down the copycats once BedBand was granted a patent; it was a year after sales started dropping, but it was too late. The patent didn\u2019t stop competitors from leaving negative one-star reviews on BedBand\u2019s listings: \u201cYou start looking a bit deeper...and you can see they\u2019ve left five-star reviews for our competitors. Or you\u2019ll see that two different buyers have been reviewing the same type of products, our competitors\u2019 products,\u201d Whaley said.  BedBand is currently the best-selling fastener, but that may not be for long. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful, knowing that Amazon is our big store,\u201d she said. To diversify revenue income, Whaley started selling BedBands on Walmart.com, Jet.com, Sears.com, and other retailers. Whaley was careful about how she discussed Amazon, which is her primary source of income \u2014\u201cI don\u2019t want to mess where I nest,\u201d she said \u2014 but seemed uneasy about being at the whim of Amazon\u2019s algorithms: \u201cSome days, all of a sudden we\u2019re fifth. When you see a fast shift like that and [our competitors] end up with reviews all of a sudden, it\u2019s frustrating. You just don\u2019t know if tomorrow these competitors will knock our sales down.\u201d Paid review writing is the modern lemonade stand. According to the people who do it, it\u2019s a quick, easy way to earn a few bucks and get free stuff \u2014 but not a career. And because the bidding, writing, and transaction happen online, it can all be done from a laptop in your bedroom. Many reviewers who spoke to BuzzFeed News are men in their late teens or early twenties who viewed the activity as a hobby. All wished to remain anonymous, out of fear of being caught by Amazon, which typically results in revoked reviewing privileges or, in the most severe cases, being banned from reusing the same delivery address or payment method with a new account. Josh, which is not his real name, is fairly new to reviewing; he discovered it through \/r\/slavelabour. He said he\u2019s in it for the stuff: \u201cYou get to keep the product, so that\u2019s a plus. It\u2019s interesting to test out new and unique products in my opinion.\u201d The most industrious paid reviewers become moderators and begin facilitating review deals themselves. Frank, whose name has been changed, manages an Amazon review Slack channel in his spare time. The entrepreneurial 18-year-old scours Amazon for products that aren\u2019t well-rated and offers the product\u2019s seller his Slack channel\u2019s review services. Listings with a small number of reviews and a low-star rating are ideal candidates. \u201cIf [a product listing] has 30 reviews with an average of 2.5 stars, it\u2019s worth it and I\u2019ll reach out,\u201d he said. Frank only earns about $20 from reviews a month, and sometimes a bit extra through seller negotiations. \u201cI get about 30% for every review that one of our reviewers does,\u201d he said. The bulk of Frank\u2019s review income comes from reselling the items he reviews on eBay, where he makes \u201cabout a couple hundred\u201d monthly. Another reviewer, whom we\u2019ll call Evan, is part of a private 10-person Slack channel and makes about $75 a month from reviews. He\u2019s left more than 150 reviews for items like weighted workout vests, 30-day hair growth pills, and car phone chargers. \u201cIt\u2019s great for small investments and savings I\u2019m working on,\u201d he said. To write his commissioned reviews, Evan takes inspiration from existing reviews, \u201cthen I\u2019ll cobble together a few keywords.\u201d One reviewer, Devan, who asked to be identified by his first name only, however, denies any wrongdoing and doesn\u2019t mind being named. The college student swears he provides nothing but his honest opinion and thinks incentivized Amazon reviews aren\u2019t a scam. He did not know incentivized reviews violated Amazon's terms of service until BuzzFeed News told him. He did admit he benefits from incentivized reviews (which he writes daily): He reuses the bubble wrap and other shipping materials from Amazon for his eBay business, through which he resells items bought on clearance. But incentivized reviews on Amazon, he says, are just an evolution of marketing tactics that have been around for a long time. \u201cAt a sporting event, Mountain Dew will hand out soda for free, and if people like it they post on social media or whatever. It\u2019s kind of the same thing, and like at Costco or Walmart, where you get free samples,\u201d Devan said. \u201cSome of these sellers are mom and pop shops, and a lot of companies just want your honest feedback...I know a lot of people who [review] aren\u2019t in it for the money. They\u2019re just trying to find better products for people,\u201d Devan said. Devan's right \u2014 there are \u201cmom and pop shops\u201d on Amazon, like Whaley\u2019s BedBand business. But an increasing number of sellers are folks with little e-commerce experience or product expertise, looking to take advantage of Amazon\u2019s millions of customers \u2014 and they need high ratings to supplant the existing best-seller. Through the \u201cAmazon FBA\u201d or \u201cFulfillment by Amazon\u201d program, anyone can open their own Amazon storefront. It\u2019s easy: Buy products in bulk from an online wholesale supplier, like AliExpress, then send the inventory to one of Amazon\u2019s warehouses, where Amazon will take care of all aspects of distribution, from payment to order fulfillment to shipping.  David, whose name has been changed, is an FBA seller who has considered buying five-star reviews. \u201cIt feels like the people making the most money are those who are violating Amazon\u2019s terms of service,\u201d he said. David didn\u2019t invent anything. He didn\u2019t go to medical school. But he makes about $1,000 a month selling suture training pads for medical professionals on Amazon. \u201cIt\u2019s a hobby, like video games. Plus, Warren Buffett said something like, \u2018If you want to make money, you have to practice making money.\u2019\u201d David got started using a site called Jungle Scout. A subscription, which costs about $350 per year, provides metrics that show what products Amazon customers are buying a lot of \u2014 and features categories where the top seller has a poor or average star rating. That mediocre star rating indicates that there\u2019s an opportunity in the market for another seller to poach some of that low-rated product\u2019s customers. \u201cWhat I found were suture pads, like a simulation skin for medical students. Then I went on Alibaba. All the Chinese suppliers are on there and they fulfill bulk orders.\u201d David \u2014 and other FBA sellers like him \u2014 swarmed the Amazon suture pad market. \u201cThe original guy, the guy whose product was featured on Jungle Scout, started losing a lot of sales because of all the competition,\u201d he said. It became apparent, according to David, that the seller, Your Design Medical, was leaving one- and two-star reviews on competitors\u2019 products. (Amazon said that, after an investigation, it did not find Your Design Medical guilty of reviews abuse. Your Design Medical did not respond to a request for comment sent to its customer support email address from BuzzFeed News.) The only new seller performing well, in spite of the original seller\u2019s bad reviews, was also, in David\u2019s view, \u201ccheating the system.\u201d \u201cThe listing had 33 five-star reviews. There\u2019s no way you can get 33 reviews in two months. That\u2019s unusual for a product like this,\u201d he said. In the end, David didn\u2019t end up buying reviews \u2014 but added that \u201cif I really needed FBA for my income, I would have.\u201d Many compensated reviewers, and the sellers who hire them, don\u2019t see themselves as bad actors. They\u2019re just one of the thousands of other reviewers and sellers doing the exact same thing. Taking shortcuts, they say, is just leveling the playing field. Inside Amazon\u2019s massive marketplace, there are lots of places to hide, to optimize, to cheat \u2014 and, because sellers can\u2019t control the algorithms, they\u2019ll do everything they can to sway them. Amazon has tried to crack down on the review fraud on its platform. The company has sued more than 1,000 people for writing or selling fake reviews. In its 2015 suit against freelancers on the website Fiverr, Amazon said it \u201ctakes the credibility of its customer reviews seriously,\u201d and also asserted, \u201cWhile small in number, these reviews can significantly undermine the trust that consumers and the vast majority of sellers and manufacturers place in Amazon, which in turn tarnishes Amazon\u2019s brand.\u201d In its seller marketplace guidelines, provided to BuzzFeed News by a third-party seller, Amazon says that sellers \u201cmay not offer compensation for a review, and you may not review your own products or your competitors\u2019 products.\u201d Sellers can \u201cask buyers to write a review in a neutral manner,\u201d without asking specifically for positive reviews, or \u201cask reviewers to change or remove their reviews.\u201d And yet all of these behaviors persist. This card, which was shipped to Amazon customer Jeff Axelrod along with his order, requests a five-star review in exchange for a $10 Amazon gift certificate. In this email to another Amazon customer, a seller asks a customer to update his review after initiating a refund. Sam Feldman started selling CardBuddy, a stick-on wallet for phones, on Amazon as a college student. CardBuddy was the first leather product of its kind on Amazon, but Feldman didn\u2019t have a patent. Competitors quickly copied the product, its packaging, and even used CardBuddy\u2019s photos. One seller had gained 500 reviews in two months. According to Feldman, the reviews were \u201cclearly fake.\u201d \u201cOne day my sales were cut in half, and it was so upsetting,\u201d Feldman told BuzzFeed News. \u201cIt stayed like that forever. More competition came, and maybe they had better photos or better titles\u2026but I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. An Amazon spokesperson said, \u201cWe encourage rights owners who have product authenticity concerns to notify us; we investigate all claims thoroughly. We remove suspected counterfeit items as we become aware of them, and we permanently remove bad actors from selling on Amazon.\u201d Feldman says that the company promptly took down the copycat listing and marked CardBuddy as the copyright holder of its own photos. But according to Feldman, it took a few months for Amazon to remove the hundreds of disingenuous reviews. Feldman thinks Amazon could do more to tackle fraudulence on the platform: \u201cFrom one side, Amazon started this business, and they\u2019re inviting people in to sell on their website. Amazon is looking out for the system as a whole, and not for me, which I understand. But, at the same time, what do you do when someone\u2019s making a living off of it?\u201d Shutting down disingenuous reviews is tricky for Amazon. By doing so, the company risks alienating sellers, a core part of its business. In 2017, more than half of units sold on Amazon globally were from third-party sellers, and more than 140,000 of what Amazon defines as \u201csmall and medium-sized businesses\u201d surpassed $100,000 in sales. The company earns revenue not only from hosting product listings but from each sale made through the site, from fulfillment fees based on weight for each shipping order and use of storage real estate in its fulfillment centers. Revenue from seller services accounted for $23 billion in 2016. Amazon is the place to be for e-commerce sellers and is increasingly seen as a utility. In 2017, Amazon accounted for nearly half of all e-commerce sales in the US (44%) with $196.8 billion in sales. Like entrepreneurs during the dot-com boom, people are rushing to sell on Amazon, and sites like AliExpress make it easy for anyone to acquire massive amounts of inventory. (AliExpress even runs its own fulfillment program.) This rush \u2014 which includes acquiring positive reviews to rise to the top of Amazon\u2019s search algorithms to sell off that inventory as quickly as possible \u2014 can displace sellers, who are less in tune with the velocity and inhumanity of the platform\u2019s algorithms and how punishing they can be as a result. The company, through lawsuits, human moderators, and algorithms, is trying to keep fake reviews off the site, but the review mills that produce those disingenuous ratings may always be one step ahead of Amazon\u2019s ability to moderate them. Like Twitter, Facebook, and Google, Amazon set out to create a neutral platform and invited the internet to come and make something of it. But like Twitter, Facebook, and Google, Amazon allowed its platform to be big and comprehensive \u2014 and grow far beyond its control. But the difference between Amazon and, say, Twitter, is that its users\u2019 livelihoods are dependent on the former. Meanwhile, Amazon\u2019s customers \u2014 left in the dark about the sophisticated mechanics behind the seemingly genuine reviews that guide their purchasing decisions \u2014 continue to buy products of shoddy quality that don\u2019t meet their expectations.  Whaley paused for a while when asked what more Amazon could do to keep reviews off the platform. \u201cThe fake reviews and sales are so intertwined now. I don\u2019t know how they can get rid of it. It seems hopeless. The reviews process was amazing when they started it, but it\u2019s been so corrupted now,\u201d she said. With a heavy sigh, Whaley continued: \u201cAmazon really is\u2014 It is a great site, but as prevalent as fake reviews are over the internet, I don\u2019t know how anybody can get in front of it. Cheaters are always going to cheat.\u201d \u25cf The story has been updated to clarify that there are 58.5 million reviews in ReviewMeta's dataset, of which 9.1% (or 5.3 million) have been identified as \"unnatural.\" An earlier version of this story misstated the number of reviews in ReviewMeta\u2019s dataset. This story has been updated with post-publication information from an Amazon spokesperson, regarding the percentage of authentic reviews the company identified in March (less than 1%). \n  buzzfeed.com\n  \n      Nicole Nguyen covers products and personal technology for BuzzFeed News and is based in San Francisco.\n     \n     Contact Nicole Nguyen at nicole.nguyen@buzzfeed.com.\n     \n     Got a confidential tip?

A review by the World Health Organization found compelling evidence that both diets reduce the risk of the common diseases, but noted that only 15 out of 53 countries in its European region had measures in place to promote the diets. The authors of the report compiled evidence on the health impacts of the two diets from academic journals, conference papers and books, then reviewed government and health ministry websites for national policies and guidelines on healthy eating. Eight countries including Ireland, Spain and Greece promoted the benefits of the Mediterranean-style diet, while seven including Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland recommended people adopt a Nordic-style diet to remain healthy. \u201cBoth of these diets are really good in terms of impact on health. That is not in doubt,\u201d said Joa\u0303o Breda from the WHO\u2019s European office for prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases. \u201cWe wanted to know whether countries were using them to inform healthy eating policies.\u201d In England, the government recommends people eat five portions of fruit and vegetables per day on the back of evidence that such a diet can reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. But ministers have been accused of doing too little to discourage unhealthy eating, despite a rise in childhood obesity rates to 10%. The traditional Mediterranean diet is rich in fruit, vegetables, nuts, cereals and olive oil, includes a moderate amount of fish and poultry, and has very little dairy, red meat, processed meat and sweets. The Nordic diet is similar, focusing on vegetables, berries, pulses, whole grain cereals and fatty fish such as herring, mackerel and salmon. Instead of olive oil, the Nordic diet favours rapeseed oil. According to the report, both diets helped to reduce cases of chronic illnesses, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some cancers. Many of the conditions are driven by obesity. According to Cancer Research UK, more than one in 20 cancers are linked to being overweight or obese. The number of adults and older teens with diabetes has doubled in the past 20 years on the back of rising obesity rates, with 3.7 million people aged 17 or older now living with the disease.  \u201cAll countries need to do more in terms of promoting good diets, because we have an emergency here,\u201d Breda said. \u201cWe are not recommending any particular diet, but when countries think about the improvements they want to make, they might be inspired by these diets. If you adopt them, you save the health system money. There are lots of advantages.\u201d","time":1525789817,"title":"Embrace Mediterranean or Nordic diets to cut disease, WHO says","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/science\/2018\/may\/07\/embrace-mediterranean-or-nordic-diets-to-cut-disease-who-says","label":7,"label_name":"random"},{"by":"tysone","descendants":20,"id":17021011,"kids":"[17024940, 17023817, 17022887, 17022934, 17023109, 17023496, 17029858, 17024594]","score":93,"text":"Advertisement Supported by By David Brooks Opinion Columnist This column is about a man who changed the world, at least twice. I want to focus less on the impact of his work, which is all around us, and more on how he did it, because he\u2019s a model of how you do social change. Stewart Brand was born in Rockford, Ill., in 1938, the son of an advertising executive. By the early 1960s, he felt alienated from boring, bourgeois suburbia and concluded that Native Americans had a lot to teach the rest of us about how to lead a more authentic way of life. In 1965, he created a multimedia presentation called \u201cAmerica Needs Indians,\u201d which he performed at the LSD-laced, proto-hippie gatherings he helped organize in California. Brand then had two epiphanies. First, there were no public photos of the entire earth. Second, if people like him were going to return to the land and lead natural lives, they would need tools. He lobbied NASA to release a photograph of the whole earth, which became an iconic image for the environmental movement. Then he slapped the picture on the cover of what he called the \u201cWhole Earth Catalog.\u201d The catalog was an encyclopedia of useful items for people heading to a commune \u2014 home weaving kits, potter\u2019s wheels, outdoor gear. But it was also a bible for what would come to be known as the counterculture, full of reading lists and rich with the ideas of Buckminster Fuller and others. \u201cWhole Earth Catalog\u201d sold 2.5 million copies, won the National Book Award and defined an era. When a culture changes, it\u2019s often because a small group of people on society\u2019s margins find a better way to live, parts of which the mainstream adopts. Brand found a magic circle in the Bay Area counterculture. He celebrated it, publicized it, gave it a coherence it otherwise lacked and encouraged millions to join. The catalog featured an iconic central character, the Cowboy Nomad, who served as symbol and role model. Brand took influences from different parts of America \u2014 the New York art world, farmers, academic visionaries like Marshal McLuhan \u2014 and synthesized them into one ethos. He crowdsourced later editions, asking readers to recommend other cool products to feature. The communes fizzled. But on the other side of the Bay Area, Brand sensed another cultural wave building. Back in the 1960s, computers seemed like the ultimate establishment device \u2014 IBM and the government used them to reduce people to punch cards. But Brand and others imagined them launching a consciousness revolution \u2014 personal tools to build neural communities that would blow the minds of mainstream America. As Fred Turner says in \u201cFrom Counterculture to Cyberculture,\u201d \u201cWhat the communes failed to accomplish, the computers would complete.\u201d Brand played cultural craftsman once again, this time first as a celebratory journalist. In 1972 he wrote a piece for Rolling Stone announcing the emergence of a new outlaw hacker culture. The hackers were another magic circle on the cutting edge of the future, a circle Brand would publicize and inspire others to join. As my Times colleague John Markoff, who is writing a biography of Brand, notes, Brand is a talented community architect. In the 1970s, he was meshing Menlo Park computer geeks with cool hippie types. The tech people were entranced by \u201cWhole Earth,\u201d including Steve Jobs and Frederick Moore, co-creator of the celebrated Homebrew Computer Club. Brand meshed the engineers with the Merry Pranksters and helped give tech a moral ethos, a group identity, a sense of itself as a transformational force for good. In 1985, Brand and Larry Brilliant helped create the Well, an early online platform (like Usenet) where techies could meet and share. He helped Kevin Kelly organize hacker conferences, which attracted media attention. As Silicon Valley became more corporate in the 1980s and 1990s, he also helped form the Learning Conferences, Worldview Meetings, the Global Business Net and other convenings that gathered the multidisciplinary theorists and journalists who would define the wired culture: Kelly, Esther Dyson, Tim Berners-Lee and Nicholas Negroponte. Brand\u2019s gift, Frank Foer writes in \u201cWorld Without Mind,\u201d is \u201cto channel the spiritual longings of his generation and then to explain how they could be fulfilled through technology.\u201d Innovations don\u2019t just proceed by science alone; as Foer continues, \u201cthe culture prods them into existence.\u201d Turner argues that Brand has always craved a sensation of wholeness, a feeling of belonging and authenticity. He has found communities that gave him that sensation and has encouraged millions to love what he has loved. He synthesized a cultural ethos, and then tried to embody and spread that ethos through festivals, conferences and organizations. Brand vehemently disagrees with me, but I\u2019d say that, more recently, the computer has also failed as a source of true community. Social media seems to immiserate people as much as it bonds them. And so there\u2019s a need for future Brands, young cultural craftsmen who identify those who are building the future, synthesizing their work into a common ethos and bringing them together in a way that satisfies the eternal desire for community and wholeness.

It's packed with best practices and examples. Start Learning Docker \u2192 Updated on May 8th, 2018 in  #deployment   Quick Jump:  How Did It Happen? | Fixing the Problem in a Few Seconds | Avoiding the Problem in the Future | Domain Validation Should Be More Strict When people talk about a site being compromised, usually you would think that your server has been compromised. That would be someone gaining access to your server and then doing whatever they please. That didn\u2019t happen here. I take security very seriously. I have SSH locked down to only allow SSH key based logins and even root logins are disabled. My site is static too, which means it\u2019s only being hosted through nginx from a non-root user. The only way someone is going to gain access to my server is if they manage to gain access to my workstation and steal my SSH key pair. The odds of that are remote because my workstation never leaves my office and I have the reflexes of a highly trained ninja. So how did a subdomain of mine end up help distributing 390,000+ PDF books without my server being compromised? Well, that\u2019s easy\u2026  It boils down to this. About 2 years ago I was recording a video course that dealt with setting up HTTPS on a domain name. In all of my courses, I make sure to \u201creally\u201d do it on video so that you can see the entire process from end to end. Back then I used nickjanetakis.com for all of my courses, so I didn\u2019t have a dedicated domain name for the course I was working on, such as diveintodocker.com. I also didn\u2019t have a spare domain name that I wanted to publicly share, so I registered a new DigitalOcean droplet to host an example site on. Then I set up an A record to point ssl.nickjanetakis.com to that droplet\u2019s IP address. Cool, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Set up a temporary site for recording the course and then delete it afterwards. Easy peasy, and that\u2019s exactly what I did but I forgot to remove the A record when I was done. So for years, I had ssl.nickjanetakis.com pointing to an IP address that I was no longer in control of. That means the owner of that IP address could host anything and it would automatically be mapped to ssl.nickjanetakis.com without me knowing. I have Google Alerts set up so I get emailed when people link to my site. A few months ago I started to receive an absurd amount of notifications, but I ignored them. I chalked it up to \u201cGoogle is probably on drugs\u201d. Stranger things have happened with Google, so I thought maybe something got mixed up. Now I\u2019ve learned my lesson. While bugs roll out into production all the time, Google Alerts being totally busted is super unlikely. Part of my morning routine is to check emails with intent to answer any questions about my courses that may have happened during the night. I usually skim the subject lines to see which emails to answer first but one of them caught my eye. It read \u201cHi, seems your website has been compromised\u201d. Well you don\u2019t see that every day. I figured it was spam that somehow made it to my inbox but I recognized the email because it was someone who signed up for one of my courses. He sent me a screenshot showing a few PDFs being hosted from ssl.nickjanetakis.com, so I immediately went to Google and searched for site:ssl.nickjanetakis.com.  It was mostly college books but there was a ton of other stuff too. Hopefully by the time you read this most of them have been removed from Google\u2019s index.  Since it was linked to a subdomain I instantly knew what was wrong, especially because I remember using that subdomain a few years ago when I made that course. The fix was really easy. I just hopped over to my domain registrar\u2019s DNS settings and deleted the entry that mapped the IP address to that subdomain. But before deleting it, I copied the IP address so I could open a support ticket on DigitalOcean. I figured they would like to know that someone is illegally distributing content on one of their servers. Now that they know the IP address, they can shut it down.  Always remove unused records from your DNS settings when you\u2019re done using them. DigitalOcean and many other cloud providers have purchased blocks of IP addresses and they provide these IP addresses to people like you and me. When a droplet gets destroyed, the IP address eventually gets put into the public pool of available IP addresses and someone else will get it. This is pretty scary because things like the above can happen if you\u2019re not careful, but it also means if an IP address were blacklisted for doing something questionable, you might end up with that IP address in the future (but that\u2019s a totally different problem).  I think this brings up an interesting question. Right now you can validate you own a domain by putting an HTML snippet on your page. Services like Google Analytics allow for this. Technically the person who took control over ssl.nickjanetakis.com could have proven ownership of that subdomain if they set up a page and hooked it up to Google Analytics. Also, Let\u2019s Encrypt\u2019s web server based challenge would have passed. I know I made a stupid mistake by not removing the A record but this could happen to anyone. I would like to see more services only allow for DNS based authentication by adding TXT records. Although I suppose the bigger problem here is having IP addresses being recycled. Hopefully once IPv6 is fully in use we\u2019ll have a big enough pool so that hosting providers can remove previously used addresses from their pool. That won\u2019t be fool proof, but it\u2019s a start. Has this ever happened to you? Let me know in the comments below!

The attack was executed through a network of hacked \u201cInternet of Things\u201d (IoT) devices such as Internet routers, security cameras and digital video recorders. A new study that tries to measure the direct cost of that one attack for IoT device users whose machines were swept up in the assault found that it may have cost device owners a total of $323,973.75 in excess power and added bandwidth consumption. My bad. But really, none of it was my fault at all. It was mostly the fault of IoT makers for shipping cheap, poorly designed products (insecure by default), and the fault of customers who bought these IoT things and plugged them onto the Internet without changing the things\u2019 factory settings (passwords at least.)  The botnet that hit my site in Sept. 2016 was powered by the first version of Mirai, a malware strain that wriggles into dozens of IoT devices left exposed to the Internet and running with factory-default settings and passwords. Systems infected with Mirai are forced to scan the Internet for other vulnerable IoT devices, but they\u2019re just as often used to help launch punishing DDoS attacks. By the time of the first Mirai attack on this site, the young masterminds behind Mirai had already enslaved more than 600,000 IoT devices for their DDoS armies. But according to an interview with one of the admitted and convicted co-authors of Mirai, the part of their botnet that pounded my site was a mere slice of firepower they\u2019d sold for a few hundred bucks to a willing buyer. The attack army sold to this ne\u2019er-do-well harnessed the power of just 24,000 Mirai-infected systems (mostly security cameras and DVRs, but some routers, too). These 24,000 Mirai devices clobbered my site for several days with data blasts of up to 620 Gbps. The attack was so bad that my pro-bono DDoS protection provider at the time \u2014 Akamai \u2014 had to let me go because the data firehose pointed at my site was starting to cause real pain for their paying customers. Akamai later estimated that the cost of maintaining protection against my site in the face of that onslaught would have run into the millions of dollars. We\u2019re getting better at figuring out the financial costs of DDoS attacks to the victims (5, 6 or 7 -digit dollar losses) and to the perpetrators (zero to hundreds of dollars). According to a report released this year by DDoS mitigation giant NETSCOUT Arbor, fifty-six percent of organizations last year experienced a financial impact from DDoS attacks for between $10,000 and $100,000, almost double the proportion from 2016. But what if there were also a way to work out the cost of these attacks to the users of the IoT devices which get snared by DDos botnets like Mirai? That\u2019s what researchers at University of California, Berkeley School of Information sought to determine in their new paper, \u201crIoT: Quantifying Consumer Costs of Insecure Internet of Things Devices.\u201d If we accept the UC Berkeley team\u2019s assumptions about costs borne by hacked IoT device users (more on that in a bit), the total cost of added bandwidth and energy consumption from the botnet that hit my site came to $323,973.95. This may sound like a lot of money, but remember that broken down among 24,000 attacking drones the per-device cost comes to just $13.50. So let\u2019s review: The attacker who wanted to clobber my site paid a few hundred dollars to rent a tiny portion of a much bigger Mirai crime machine. That attack would likely have cost millions of dollars to mitigate. The consumers in possession of the IoT devices that did the attacking probably realized a few dollars in losses each, if that. Perhaps forever unmeasured are the many Web sites and Internet users whose connection speeds are often collateral damage in DDoS attacks. Image: UC Berkeley. Anyone noticing a slight asymmetry here in either costs or incentives? IoT security is what\u2019s known as an \u201cexternality,\u201d a term used to describe \u201cpositive or negative consequences to third parties that result from an economic transaction. When one party does not bear the full costs of its actions, it has inadequate incentives to avoid actions that incur those costs.\u201d In many cases negative externalities are synonymous with problems that the free market has a hard time rewarding individuals or companies for fixing or ameliorating, much like environmental pollution. The common theme with externalities is that the pain points to fix the problem are so diffuse and the costs borne by the problem so distributed across international borders that doing something meaningful about it often takes a global effort with many stakeholders \u2014 who can hopefully settle upon concrete steps for action and metrics to measure success. The paper\u2019s authors explain the misaligned incentives on two sides of the IoT security problem: -\u201cOn the manufacturer side, many devices run lightweight Linux-based operating systems that open doors for hackers. Some consumer IoT devices implement minimal security. For example, device manufacturers may use default username and password credentials to access the device. Such design decisions simplify device setup and troubleshooting, but they also leave the device open to exploitation by hackers with access to the publicly-available or guessable credentials.\u201d -\u201cConsumers who expect IoT devices to act like user-friendly \u2018plug-and-play\u2019 conveniences may have sufficient intuition to use the device but insufficient technical knowledge to protect or update it. Externalities may arise out of information asymmetries caused by hidden information or misaligned incentives. Hidden information occurs when consumers cannot discern product characteristics and, thus, are unable to purchase products that reflect their preferences. When consumers are unable to observe the security qualities of software, they instead purchase products based solely on price, and the overall quality of software in the market suffers.\u201d The UC Berkeley researchers concede that their experiments \u2014 in which they measured the power output and bandwidth consumption of various IoT devices they\u2019d infected with a sandboxed version of Mirai \u2014 suggested that the scanning and DDoSsing activity prompted by a Mirai malware infection added almost negligible amounts in power consumption for the infected devices. Thus, most of the loss figures cited for the 2016 attack rely heavily on estimates of how much the excess bandwidth created by a Mirai infection might cost users directly, and as such I suspect the $13.50 per machine estimates are on the high side. No doubt, some Internet users get online via an Internet service provider that includes a daily \u201cbandwidth cap,\u201d such that over-use of the allotted daily bandwidth amount can incur overage fees and\/or relegates the customer to a slower, throttled connection for some period after the daily allotted bandwidth overage. But for a majority of high-speed Internet users, the added bandwidth use from a router or other IoT device on the network being infected with Mirai probably wouldn\u2019t show up as an added line charge on their monthly bills. I asked the researchers about the considerable wiggle factor here: \u201cRegarding bandwidth consumption, the cost may not ever show up on a consumer\u2019s bill, especially if the consumer has no bandwidth cap,\u201d reads an email from the UC Berkeley researchers who wrote the report, including Kim Fong, Kurt Hepler, Rohit Raghavan and Peter Rowland. \u201cWe debated a lot on how to best determine and present bandwidth costs, as it does vary widely among users and ISPs,\u201d they continued. \u201cCosts are more defined in cases where bots cause users to exceed their monthly cap. But even if a consumer doesn\u2019t directly pay a few extra dollars at the end of the month, the infected device is consuming actual bandwidth that must be supplied\/serviced by the ISP. And it\u2019s not unreasonable to assume that ISPs will eventually pass their increased costs onto consumers as higher monthly fees, etc. It\u2019s difficult to quantify the consumer-side costs of unauthorized use \u2014 which is likely why there\u2019s not much existing work \u2014 and our stats are definitely an estimate, but we feel it\u2019s helpful in starting the discussion on how to quantify these costs.\u201d  Measuring bandwidth and energy consumption may turn out to be a useful and accepted tool to help more accurately measure the full costs of DDoS attacks. I\u2019d love to see these tests run against a broader range of IoT devices in a much larger simulated environment. If the Berkeley method is refined enough to become accepted as one of many ways to measure actual losses from a DDoS attack, the reporting of such figures could make these crimes more likely to be prosecuted. Many DDoS attack investigations go nowhere because\u00a0targets of these attacks fail to come forward or press charges, making it difficult for prosecutors to prove any real economic harm was done. Since many of these investigations die on the vine for a lack of financial damages reaching certain law enforcement thresholds to justify a federal prosecution (often $50,000 \u2013 $100,000), factoring in estimates of the cost to hacked machine owners involved in each attack could change that math. But the biggest levers for throttling the DDoS problem are in the hands of the people running the world\u2019s largest ISPs, hosting providers and bandwidth peering points on the Internet today. Some of those levers I detailed in the \u201cShaming the Spoofers\u201d section of The Democraticization of Censorship, the first post I wrote after the attack and after Google had brought this site back online\u00a0under its Project Shield program. By the way, we should probably stop referring to IoT devices as \u201csmart\u201d when they start misbehaving within three minutes of being plugged into an Internet connection. That\u2019s about how long your average cheapo, factory-default security camera plugged into the Internet has before getting successfully taken over by Mirai. In short, dumb IoT devices are those that don\u2019t make it easy for owners to use them safely without being a nuisance or harm to themselves or others. Maybe what we need to fight this onslaught of dumb devices are more network operators turning to ideas like IDIoT, a network policy enforcement architecture for consumer IoT devices that was first proposed in December 2017.\u00a0 The goal of IDIoT is to restrict the network capabilities of IoT devices to only what is essential for regular device operation. For example, it might be okay for network cameras to upload a video file somewhere, but it\u2019s definitely not okay for that camera to then go scanning the Web for other cameras to infect and enlist in DDoS attacks. So what does all this mean to you? That depends on how many IoT things you and your family and friends are plugging into the Internet and your\/their level of knowledge about how to secure and maintain these devices.\u00a0Here\u2019s a primer on minimizing the chances that your orbit of IoT things become a security liability for you or for the Internet at large. \n Tags: Akamai, DDoS, google, IdioT, internet of things, IoT, Kim Fong, Kurt Hepler, mirai, NETSCOUT Arbor, Peter Rowland, Project Shield, Rohit Raghavan, UC Berkeley \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis entry was posted on Monday, May 7th, 2018 at 12:47 pm\t\t\t\t\t\tand is filed under DDoS-for-Hire.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou can follow any comments to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou can skip to the end and leave a comment.

Pet peeve: \u201c$323,973.75\u201d   Since this is really just a wild assed guess, it would be nice if Berkeley emphasized this by using less precise figures, like \u201cabout $300,000.\u201d That was Krebs\u2019 estimate using their online tool, which outputs a figure based on the data you input. Their papers actually says \u201cthe median cost is close to $300,000\u201d. It seems that we have come a long way some times then not really that far since the first telegraph or semaphore and now with the digital internet and so many digital devices, operating systems and software.  At the beginning of telephone Northern Electric was started to manufacture telephone so there might be uniformity. There is no real uniformity with all the digital devices and those using them are expecting they do everything for them, including protect them. I used to use a user configurable firewall that was very good as it blocked everything in or out without permission, it also showed all attempts on my system. This firewall is now very old but I feel this is what we need on all of our devices, also to educate people like safe sex to protect themselves. Maybe some will listen and others be the same as before. It was Gilfoyl. lmao! You\u2019re a legend, Brian Krebs. Keep up the good work! I find it extremely hard to believe that someone would make an attempt to knock your blog online. Nevertheless; you are a legend, Brian Krebs. Keep up the good work! \u201conline\u201d  \u2013 was there a misspelling?  I can believe it, because many of us couldn\u2019t reach his site for days during this DDOS attack! He was definitely knocked OFFLINE. I do remember being unable to access his site, yet I wouldn\u2019t have guessed any intentional disruption to the blog. Someone with a disliking to Krebs, perhaps? You havent been paying enough attention then, lol.  I believe this site was hit after Brian doxxed the owners of vDOS, which led to their arrest, or after he doxxed the creator of Mirai, which eventually led to his arrest.  Im willing to bet there are quite a few criminals out there who dont like Brian. The externality analogy is okay, but in my view that applies more to situations like Person A taking an action that hurts Person B without intending to do so.  For example, I drive my car, which pollutes your air, hurting you.  Driving my car creates an externality on you, but I am not intending to hurt you, and probably don\u2019t know who you are. I think a better analogy might be that of asymetric or hybrid warfare, where Combatant A (e.g. an insurgency) can attack Combatant B (e.g. an army) at low cost, because it attacks in limited unpredictable locations, uses unexpected strategies or weapons that are hard to counter, etc.  Think of Iraq after the \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d fiasco:  small groups of insurgents with inexpensive weapons caused the American government to spend billions of dollars to defend thousands of US soldiers. Just a thought, calculate the costs and access a treble damage fine on the miscreants.  That would probably include the IoT device makers. Bought a new router the other day, so I could handle the new fiber speeds. The technician thought I was crazy for changing the administrator side login password \u2013 Many of you know the  one \u201cadmin\u201d \u201cpassword\u201d \u2013 talk about idiots, those manufacturers need to make it easier for newbies to setup things like that \u2013 oddly enough, this manufacturer did supply its own user ID and generated password for the wireless but not the LAN Ethernet administration side. My technician just couldn\u2019t believe that malware can take over your router from the user side of the network!!! How many years has this been a problem??!! Sheeze, if he didn\u2019t know this, how is Joe Sixpack going to figure it out??!! Unsuprisingly, many router manufacturers ship their routers with a configuration of the sort you just described; which makes installation \u2018easier\u2019 for the average consumer, but is still a terrible security practice. I\u2019ve had a pretty good experience with the AirPort line of routers, manufactured by Apple; they\u2019re fairly simple to install, but are coupled with considerable in-built security. Many \u2018firmwares\u2019 pre-installed with routers are just down-right horrendous. Just remember to disable WAN side administration in case the criminals find a backdoor or an OEM master key; and change the factory default password for the LAN side access. Unfortunately, Apple has recently discontinued the AirPort line. I read about this, and it\u2019s very sad to me; but, since I\u2019ve never had to repair (or service) one, I don\u2019t plan to \u2018replace\u2019 my AirPort station any time soon. Ne\u2019er-do-well? Don\u2019t you mean \u201cmiscreant?\u201d Seriously, how can owners of the \u201cthings\u201d tell when their thing is misbehaving? Readily moderating network activity. and following his guide on how-to prevent such: https:\/\/krebsonsecurity.com\/2018\/01\/some-basic-rules-for-securing-your-iot-stuff\/ So Akamai provided you with a service until the time that you REALLY need it. They should thank you for allowing them to deal with something new. As it is, it just says their ddos protection is limited. While that may not be completely fair, if they think they won\u2019t have the same problem again with a different client in the future they are probably wrong. But the larger issue to me is that the ISP industry needs to get organized and find ways to deal with large scale problems. If the Mirai attack only used about 1\/24 of the botnet at that time, just imagine what it\u2019s full potential was then and may be now? ISPs need to be able to deal with attacks like this. I see no reason why an attack on a site can\u2019t be identified and then all or some bot traffic be redirected to 127.0.0.1 for a period of time. The traffic generated by the redirection could be a signal to upstream ISPs that there is a problem with local equipment. At the kind of scale we are talking about (500Gbps+), all DDoS mitigation, regardless of company delivering it, is limited. The issue is not the devices for scrubbing data, but the peering points and peering connections between ISPs and network providers. DDoS mitigation providers like to talk about \u201cmitigation capacity\u201d, but this is an aggregated capacity measured over dozens of peering points and many fibre connections. Attack traffic is not always spread evenly over peering points. There are bottlenecks. A Cloud security provider like Akamai has far more peering and greater capacity than most ISPs to try and soak up the impact of a large-scale DDoS attack, but that scale of infrastructure costs money to build and maintain and cannot be built on the principle of offering unlimited mitigation to every customer at the same time, because the cost per customer would be prohibitive. No-one knows how a given DDoS attack will appear across the peering points. There may be geographical bias (eg. infection of Chinese language browsers) or attack blended with legitimate traffic (reflection attacks) \u2013 and so each one will stress a different range of peering points. Many ISPs resort to black-holing target networks to protect their other paying customers, preferring to have one difficult conversation with the victim of a DDoS attack rather than hundreds of difficult conversations with all of their customers. However this is not satisfactory for businesses that cannot any outages at all.  Also relying on on-premise mitigation for first visibility of a DDoS attack can struggle when the connection from that site to the public Internet is flooded or disabled in and of itself. But identifying DDoS attack traffic from legitimate web-site traffic in an application attack, or when traffic is encrypted, might not be possible in the cloud. Although you might not be able to see any reason why certain solutions to DDoS attacks would not be easy to implement, I can assure you that the industry is refining responses to the DDoS threat landscape continually, and that attacks and the defences against them are becoming much more sophisticated. At the moment, some attackers abilities to DDoS exceeds anyone\u2019s ability to mitigate the impact. It\u2019s not a technical or even a political issue, but an economic one. Max \u2013 excellent illustration of the complexity of fighting big attacks. Even if defenders have really big pipes you still need to take into account the infrastructure those big pipes are connected to. How about a federal 1% tax on any internet connected device or platform? The revenue could be held in escrow with some being used to pay huge bug bounties and fund security research\/testing. If a company could provide a clean bill of health for a product after 10 years, they could get their taxes back. Government should never be entrusted with public money, regardless of the purity of intentions. It will always find a way to waste or lose that money, by virtue of the complexity and size of government itself. Great article as always, but I have a few nits to pick based on my two decades of working in IT security. First of all is the assertion that \u201cIt was mostly the fault of  [vendors]\u2026 and the fault of customers who bought these IoT things and plugged them onto the Internet without changing the things\u2019 factory settings (passwords at least.)\u201d This is one of those things where you can be right and wrong at the same time, but even the part that\u2019s right doesn\u2019t matter.  Yes, people should be more IT security conscious. They should also save money, take care of their bodies. protect the environment, etc., etc., etc. These are based on *our* perceptions of what people should do, but different people have different priorities. Whether this is right or wrong or good or bad (even if such things are possible to determine objectively) it wouldn\u2019t matter people people are going to do what they do anyway. Like the old military saying goes, you go to war with the army you have, not the army you want. In this case, we go to fight the security battles with the consumers and vendors we have, not the consumers and vendors we want. Whether we are right or wrong or they are right or wrong is irrelevant \u2013 the situation is what it is and we have to deal with it as it is.  We have about 2-3 generations of consumers taught that anything they buy is at least reasonably safe due to various consumer regulations and nanny-stating (leaving aside the moral and consequentialist arguments of whether this is good or bad or indifferent). This is combined with a fairly stark regression in critical thinking skills over the last two generations. It is unrealistic to expect consumers to develop habits for exercising any sort of security judgement in their purchasing decisions unless the costs of not doing so become both obvious and significant from their perspective. Right now they are neither, and don\u2019t hold your breath waiting for that to change. On the vendor side, we don\u2019t even have a proven theory for how to develop \u201csafe, secure\u201d computing devices. As the IT sector matures and established vendors have had difficulty finding new ways to add value to customers, they have been pushed by private equity and Wall Street to subscription-based services that provide more reliable revenue streams and growth, at least in the short- to mid-term (I suspect this will eventually backfire spectacularly \u2013 it builds too many opportunities to undercut on pricing and purchasing terms). In some cases, vendors have found ways to deliver additional value in this model but many have not. In any case, this has strongly pushed the \u201ccontinuous release\u201d software \/ firmware model which in practice has been reducing software quality control at a time it\u2019s needed most (\u201cclearing minefields with cattle, and your users are the cattle\u201d is the most apt description I\u2019ve found of this). Another vendor factor is that courts have found very little to no liability for most software flaws \u2013 I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s a productive way to address this; it is what it is and I\u2019m just pointing it out. It\u2019s very expensive to have a good software lifetime management system in place, and not all vendors have the margins and profits to allow this (especially at the low end). Addressing this would significantly increase prices for many IoT devices and probably eliminate many vendors from markets (and, in some cases, entire markets) in the short term. I think that the only practical approach will be to assume that user behavior will not change significantly and that IoT software quality will largely remain a dumpster fire. This means we have to have additional layers and methods (security systems) to deal with these issues, and that these systems will really need to \u201cup their game\u201d both in terms of efficacy and accessibility to non-geeks. One of the biggest problems in the field is that it is difficult for tools to replace protocols. In IT, you warm up a device with a checklist in hand and ensure that each step builds upon the security of the previous state so that you aren\u2019t compromising previous or subsequent steps. In userland, you plug-in a widget and *BOOM* you\u2019re on the internet! Just generating a secure warm-up checklist for a Raspberry Pi Zero (a $5 Linux computer) is a complicated pain-in-the-tuchis. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if it insisted on having a real firewalled login\/password account before it enabled network interfaces? Erik, I like the way you write sir. Well stated Erik.  I came here to say this but you did a far better job than I could have. My view is that at this time the only way to insure that your network and IoT devices are not enslaved is to not own any! I refuse to subject my environment to these criminals and I will not enrich vendors that do not give a hoot what happens to others as a result of their cr\u2026y products. Keep fighting Brian. Stick it in their eye whenever you can. On a Raspberry Pi, you essentially have all the security tools that Debian has. You can make the little credit-card-sized device nearly as hardened as an international bank. But it doesn\u2019t ship that way. All Pi\u2019s ship with the user \u201cpi\u201d and the password \u201craspberry\u201d \u2014 and a frightening number of users plug-in to the internet without changing this. A part of the problem is default passwords.  What if IoT devices were shipped with no default password, i.e. with binary zeros in the password field in non-volatile storage?  Further, the factory reset button sets that default password back to zeros. If the setup process required each user to set a password, and the device DID NOT WORK until a password was set, then there\u2019d be no more default passwords.  By \u201cnot work\u201d I mean the device should not perform its intended function until a password is set; cameras wouldn\u2019t take pictures, routers wouldn\u2019t route packets, etc. until a password is set. To be sure, there\u2019d be a bunch of \u201cpassword1\u201d and \u201c12345\u201d but there wouldn\u2019t be any more default passwords.  That won\u2019t solve the problem, but it ought to mitigate it somewhat. Back when email was new and exciting, I was taught that senders of spam had to be careful. Because, if someone sent spam, they could get the equivalent of a brick (many many answering messages) back in their own accounts.  Any way to do this now?

The safe side of what? Twitter sent out the communications after discovering what it called a bug, i.e. an internally stored file containing user passwords written in plain text.\n In a blog post, the company\u2019s chief technology officer Parag Agrawal explained the problem and reassured users that it had been both identified and addressed.\n Nevertheless, Agrawal wrote that the company is urging users to consider changing their passwords \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d.\n To be clear, there was never any indication that the file of user\u2019s account passwords in question had been misplaced, stolen, or shared with a third-party.\n But the fact that it existed at all triggered the kind of mass security warning most digital communications providers would prefer not to have to deliver at all \u2013 and especially not these days, with the Facebook data privacy scandal still ongoing.\n And then, Twitter bumbled the delivery.\n Agrawal tweeted a message suggesting that the communication and password change recommendation sent out to users was probably surplus to requirement, but was nevertheless \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d.\n He then retracted that in a later Tweet: \u201cI should not have said we didn\u2019t have to share.

But what created it? We\u2019ll probably never know.\n What his blog post adds up to is this: We found a security loophole, and shut it down. We investigated it, and found no evidence to suggest a security breach, but all users should change their password, just in case.\n In case, of what?\n In case, of course, Twitter is mistaken. In case the file has already been leaked, and a hacker is teeing up those passwords to launch misinformation and communication on a new dimension: Fake news, spread over stolen but nevertheless real Twitter accounts.\n Social media bot hacks work on the principle that if you put out a piece of information over enough bots, it will, at one point, be picked up by a real person, with a real account, and spread to friends and family members over social media. It\u2019s a numbers game.\n Most social media platforms, notably Twitter, have already made significant steps to identify and shut down tens of thousands of bots, and it\u2019s now recognised that bot-driven public opinion hacking had a hand in the 2016 US Presidential elections.\n With access to millions of real Twitter password accounts, tomorrow\u2019s democracy hackers could have the ultimate follow-up.\n Sure, it\u2019s a digital doomsday scenario. But in this day and age, its one that we all \u2013 including Twitter \u2013 need to take more seriously.\n So, if you wake up tomorrow to discover your Twitter account spewing a string of outrageous, inflammatory and possibly criminal views that you don\u2019t recognise as being your own, remember: you were warned to change your password.

Accordingly, Equifax submits this statement to supplement\nthe company\u0092s responses regarding the extent of the incident impacting U.S. consumers.  As announced on September\u00a07, 2017, the information\nstolen by the attackers primarily included:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As earlier\nstatements made clear, the company\u0092s forensics experts found no evidence that Equifax\u0092s U.S. and international core consumer, employment and income, or commercial credit reporting databases were accessed as part of the cyberattack.\nFurthermore, Equifax offered a comprehensive support package to impacted consumers on September\u00a07, 2017.  The attackers stole consumer records from a\nnumber of database tables with different schemas, and the data elements stolen were not consistently labeled. For example, not every database table contained a field for driver\u0092s license number, and for more common elements like first name, one\ntable may have labeled the column containing first name as \u0093FIRSTNAME,\u0094 another may have used \u0093USER_FIRST_NAME,\u0094 and a third may have used \u0093FIRST_NM.\u0094 With assistance from Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm, forensic\ninvestigators were able to standardize certain data elements for further analysis to determine the impacted consumers and Equifax\u0092s notification obligations.  As a result of its analysis of the standardized data elements, including using data not stolen in the attack, the company was able to confirm the approximate\nnumber of impacted U.S. consumers for each of the following data elements: name, date of birth, Social Security number, address information, gender, phone number, driver\u0092s license number, email address, payment card number and expiration date,\nTaxID, and driver\u0092s license state. As stated above, Equifax notified the public on September\u00a07, 2017 of the primary data elements that were stolen. With respect to the data elements of gender, phone number, and email addresses, U.S. state\ndata breach notification laws generally do not require notification to consumers when these data elements are compromised, particularly when an email address is not stolen in combination with further credentials that would permit access. The chart\nthat follows provides the approximate number of impacted U.S. consumers for each of the listed data elements.  \u00a0 1  \n Data Element Stolen Standardized Columns Analyzed1 Payment Card Number and Expiration Date The data described above is not additional stolen data, and it does not impact additional consumers. The table reflects a\nsummary of the company\u0092s analysis of data stolen in last year\u0092s cybersecurity incident. This includes the extra measures the company took to confirm the  \u00a0 This includes the 2.4\u00a0million individuals whose partial driver\u0092s license information and name were\nstolen, as described in the company\u0092s announcement on March\u00a01, 2018.  \u00a0 2  \n \nidentities of\u00a0U.S.\u00a0consumers whose partial driver\u0092s license information was stolen but who were not in the previously identified affected population, as announced on March\u00a01,\n2018. Equifax identified these consumers by referencing other information in proprietary company records that the attackers did not steal, and by engaging the resources of an external data provider.  Through the company\u0092s analysis, Equifax believes it has satisfied applicable requirements to notify consumers and regulators. It does not anticipate\nidentifying further impacted consumers, as it has now completed analysis of government issued identification numbers stolen together with names. It should be noted that the additional analysis also confirmed that some of the standardized columns had\nno real data in the data fields (specifically the data fields for passport numbers, CV2s, and driver\u0092s license issue dates).  Separately from the\nelements described above, which were contained within database tables and files, and as previously reported in the company\u0092s press releases4 and responses to congressional questions, the\nattackers also accessed images uploaded to Equifax\u0092s online dispute portal by approximately 182,000 U.S. consumers. As a national credit reporting agency, Equifax has a statutory obligation to facilitate disputes for consumers.  Between October and December 2017, Equifax notified by direct mail the consumers who had uploaded information to the dispute portal that their dispute\ninformation was accessed. In order to provide complete information to consumers regarding their accessed images, Equifax provided these consumers individualized notifications with a list of the specific files they had uploaded onto Equifax\u0092s\ndispute portal and the dates of those uploads.  As part of the dispute process, some consumers may have uploaded government-issued identifications through\nthe portal. Because the company directly notified each impacted consumer, the company had not previously analyzed the government-issued identifications contained in the images uploaded in the dispute portal. In response to congressional inquiry, we\nrecently completed a manual review of the images that were uploaded by the impacted consumers. The chart that follows provides the approximate number of images of valid government-issued identifications.  \u00a0 Government-Issued Identification Driver\u0092s License Social Security or Taxpayer ID Card Passport or Passport Card Other5 The data described above is not additional stolen data, and it does not impact additional consumers.

A group of lawyers bought the 17-unit Victorian building in which they had been living to convert it into offices. Unable to find a place they could afford in San Francisco, the Brandolinos ended up in the suburb of Brisbane, where the $500-a-month rent still is more than twice what it was in their rent-controlled North Beach apartment. It isn't that the family is poor. Frances Brandolino, 62, part owner of a small North Beach hamburger stand, and her husband, a printer, earn about $30,000 a year. But the family simply could not afford apartments that in North Beach go for \"$900 or $1,000 a month,\" she said. Story Is Typical The Brandolinos' story is being repeated throughout San Francisco, where a decade-long building boom has transformed the city's skyline and its population. One example is the Brandolinos' old neighborhood, once a thriving Italian district, later an enclave for beatniks, now home to chic restaurants, high-rent apartments and increasing numbers of offices. In short, San Francisco has become perhaps the most gentrified large city in the nation. Districts that a decade ago were blue collar are now ghettos for young urban professionals, who have spawned a consumptive economy in which one highly successful new chain mass markets croissants, sort of a Yuppie version of Winchell's doughnut shops. The change has created a new vocabulary:  Yuppification, croissantification, Manhattanization.  City Planning Director Dean Macris calls it the \"boutiquing of San Francisco.\" Whatever its name, its result is spiraling housing costs, clogged traffic, an exodus of middle-class and poor families and declining black and Latino populations. And the trend seems certain to continue despite a new effort by the city to limit growth, restrain housing costs and preserve neighborhoods. 'Post-Industrial City' Some social scientists call San Francisco the \"archetypical post-industrial city,\" one with an economy based not on steel plants or breweries, but on silicon chips, corporate headquarters, international trade, banking, law. And its residents reflect that. Several other big cities--Boston and Philadelphia, among them--are experiencing similar changes. But here, the difference is in degree. \"It is clear to me that San Francisco has experienced each of these changes . . . earlier and to a greater extent than any other area in the country,\" said demographer Kevin McCarthy of the Santa Monica-based Rand Corp. Of the 13 largest cities in the nation in 1980, San Francisco (current population 706,900) had the largest percentage (22%) of residents between ages 25 and 34, the segment of the population most likely to have children. It also had the lowest percentage of children 13 and younger. Of those 13 largest cities, San Francisco was one of only two that showed a drop in black population between the 1970 and 1980 censuses. San Francisco's black population declined 10%, or about 10,000. San Antonio, the only other city in the top 13 to record a loss, showed a 0.3% decline. During the same period, the number of Latinos in San Francisco also dropped by roughly 10%, or about 10,000, Latino leaders here say, although the census did not count that group separately in 1970. The number of Asians, now about a third of the population, is increasing rapidly. But for the most part, Asians and other minorities do not hold the high-paying office jobs. White Work Force A recent city report says that two-thirds of the downtown work force is white, and that whites hold three-fourths of the management and technical jobs. Those jobs have the highest salaries, with more than half paying at least $25,000, making San Francisco paychecks among the fattest of the largest cities. Growth proponents say the building boom merely reflects San Francisco's healthy economy. Bob Hayden of the Chamber of Commerce called the downtown high-rises \"vertical factories.\" And those factories keep the city's unemployment rate to about 6%. Mayor Dianne Feinstein builds on that by pitching San Francisco to foreign investors, who finance much of the construction. So far this year, she has been to London and the Far East on trade missions. But while the city bustles, some researchers sound notes of caution, not only for San Francisco but for other cities that rely on service industries for employment. Several corporations--Bank of America, Pacific Bell--have moved much of their operations to suburbs, where land costs less and where work, done largely on computer, can be done just as easily.

Press Esc to cancel.  I was part of the problem. As a journalist covering the startup ecosystem, rag-to-riches startup stories were my bread and butter. I\u2019m not saying my stories were not genuine: I\u2019m saying that I contributed to perpetuating the Big Lie of venture capital. To be fair, I was not on it. I did not know it was a lie. Of all the people, I should have been aware of the Big Lie. Unlike most people, I actually was paid to interview venture capitalists, read market research \u00a0about VC investment, failure rate of startups and so on. I knew very well launching a tech startup was a foolish move. I knew that only 0.91% of start-ups end up raising from angel investors and only 0.05% from venture capital firms.\u00a0 \n I even knew that only about 30% of FUNDED startups manage to exit. I knew angels and early-stage VCs are not investing in ideas; they\u2019re looking for a great founder, a great team, a huge market, a product that works and some kind of proof that the market wants the product. I knew delivering all of those things would be very hard without money or personal savings. But I did it. And nonetheless, I failed at closing an angel round for Hardbacon. There were a lot of angels interested and even some VC firms, but no one wanted to sign the first check. I personally spent a lot of time during the last four months meeting with prospective investors in Montreal and Toronto. And I realize now I should have been investing all my time in acquiring customers, making them happy and signing deals. I\u2019m not saying that, since I failed at raising an early-stage round, no one can. Far from that. I\u2019m just saying that, like a lot of other entrepreneurs, I naively believed the Big Lie of Venture Capital. There are a lot of early-stage rounds happening in Montreal. No questions about it. What I was naive about, like so many founders, are the requirements for raising such a round. No fewer than 38% of startups received funding from friends and family. Early-stage investors don\u2019t like to sign the first check, so they tend to prefer investing in startups that already did a friend & family round. Another thing investors like is when the founders made a sizeable investment in the startup themselves. As a result, when you read in the media about entrepreneurs starting in a garage or in a dirt-cheap apartment, well, they indeed started in those settings. It\u2019s just that they omit to mention that sure, they were working from a one-bedroom apartment, but they also had rich parents or were wealthy themselves. It\u2019s not only about the money. It\u2019s also about the great team. But what is the definition of a great team? For most investors, not mentioning their predilection for all-male founding teams and distaste for non-whites, it\u2019s either people that had a successful exit in the past or people that attended an Ivy League university, preferably Stanford or Harvard. It\u2019s no surprise that there is a disproportionate number of VCs that graduated from top universities, and that those same universities are where a disproportionate number of founders studied. And trust me, it\u2019s not only in the US. Go and check the Linkedin profiles of Canadian VCs and funded entrepreneurs, and you\u2019ll find a surprisingly high number of Ivy League educated Canadians. So, unless you come from money, attended a prestigious university in the States or sold your previous startups for a lot of money, you should assume that you\u2019re never going to raise early-stage capital. Don\u2019t use counter-examples. Sure, they exist. Sure, Oprah was a dirt-poor single mother before becoming a billionaire, but those are fairy tales. \n Bootstrapping a tech start-up is not for the faint of heart. It is extremely difficult, especially for SaaS business like Hardbacon, because we need thousands of subscribers to break even. But given the low chances of getting funded at our current stage, if I were to start-over, I would have taken the slower, but more cash-rich route of doing a little bit of services to finance our product business. As of now, I stopped taking meetings with investors to focus on signing deals with financial institutions and preparing our equity crowdfunding campaign. Yep, we\u2019ll raise money directly from our users. The problem, with the Big Lie, is that it kills a lot of startups that end up building their strategy around a capital infusion that will never come, and end-up wasting a lot of time trying to fundraise. Some of those startups would have had a better shot had they focused on sales. It\u2019s still super hard, but the odds are better. The problem is that bootstrapping success stories often remain unknown, as the valuation of those startups is never announced in press releases. Mailchimp has built a 700 employees highly profitable SaaS business out of Atlanta doing just that. Basecamp is another highly successful SaaS built out of Chicago that never raised. In Canada, there is GSOFT that built a highly profitable SaaS business out of Montreal, and PlentyOfFish, that was built out of Vancouver. When the dating website was sold for 575 million in 2015, its founder Markus Frind pocketed the whole amount, since he did not have any investor. Not a bad, hey? Julien Brault is CEO and co-founder of Hardbacon, a fintech empowering Canadians with an app that makes it easy for anyone to manage a stock market portfolio. Formerly journalist at Les Affaires in Montreal, he caught the startup fever while writing about startups and venture capital. We came to the same conclusion, my dear Julien. Last year we were the pretext for the 5 to 7 angel investors meetings. We were the wannabe Miss Universe in Bikini for the VC analysts who asked us for our Pitch Deck (and a whole bunch of other documents very strategic, very confidential, and very easy to use to advise our competitors). To refuse is also a job after all.  Today it\u2019s over. We focus on sales. We no longer believe in this lie. However, there are other lies. The \u201cparasites\u201d of the startup-system still have many tricks in their bags to make you waste time and money. The only ones who know are your peers, the other startup executives. But as no one wants to look weak, defeatist or pessimistic, they keep quiet. Thank you for your honest article that tells the truth! I\u2019m very disappointed Julien is writing like this. Sounds like a bitter and angry article that makes no sense. First of all, little support for its biggest claims. For example \u2013 that early investor don\u2019t sign the first Cheque. What\u2019s the data to back that up? Where\u2019s the data to back up that they requiere family and friends funding first? A data point was thrown \u2013 38% of startups raise from family and friends \u2013 so? If anything, it means 62% of startups raised from early investors, negating the claim.  Then, the other bold claim that VCs have a distaste for \u201cwhites\u201d in great teams is misguided. The article quoted said 87% of \u201cfunded\u201d (not great) teams were white but that the Asians were the largest funded in dollar amounts. It\u2019s just rude then to claim distaste. Moreover, that article is for the US \u2013 not Canada and is from 2010! that\u2019s 8 years ago. 1 year after Uber got started. Talk about DATED data! VCs have changed, teams have changed. I know Julien asked NOT to give examples quoting Oprah but that\u2019s not fair. Here\u2019s one: Jessica Scorpio with 2 others started GetAround in Ottawa in 2011. Super successful startup. Not captured in that data: later than 2010 and Canada. NOT a fairy tale. Hard f work.  I believe being an entrepreneur is hard. The focus is on everything: sales, operations, having enough money (raising, debt, friend and family, however) and those that succeed are the ones that are persistent, that add value, that believe they have something to give to the world. It\u2019s tough. Not getting an angel round when you wanted is just part of the deal. Just like getting a flat tire on my road trip vacation. Learn from it, adjust the course and keep going. Positive thinking attracts positive energy which attracts money, talent and success.\nWhat doesn\u2019t work is claiming everyone out there is a racist and that if you\u2019re a certain race, nationality and didn\u2019t go to certain school then you don\u2019t stand a chance is just LAME. When you BLAME other people and things for your failures you\u2019re Being LAME. Keep working hard \u2013 there is no failure. Only success and lessons learned. This is an over dramatic article. VCs take great risks, and bet on various types of ventures measuring different aspects of their EXECUTION, their ability to measure the correct KPIs, to know their client, to pivot based on real results, to sell, to build a cheap prototype in order to test their market, etc. Montreal is  VERY conservative VC market, you should take a look at Asia, where VC is bullish, and invests in ideas, talent and the ability to commercialize and execute. While there is racism and elitism for sure, these are hardly important points. VCs usually are very well connected and can help their portfolio companies get in touch with the right partners, at the right time, when they haven\u2019t got connections. If you don\u2019t have capital to start, I recommend you seek an incubator or accelerator for your seed money. Also, there is nothing wrong with seeking FFF funds, and angel investors, these are vital to take risks and invest in your idea without any traction. Although I\u2019ve been talking about the pros and cons of VC funding to friends and entrepreneurs for the past 10 years, and I\u2019m a firm believer that bootstrapping has always been the way to go, I can\u2019t fully support this article and its sweeping generalizations. It\u2019s not a lie if you\u2019re the naive one, Julien. The pros and cons have always been in front of you. Perhaps you bought into the hype more than others. Sour grapes. I bet that if Julien had gotten VC funding, he would have praised how worthy and smart the VCs are. What is even more astonishing is that he admit to have an understanding of how VCs invest and why. VCs are capitalistic organizations that invest in highly risky enterprises that can bring them a very high return. Therefore, their invesments must fit specific profiles. And if you don\u2019t fit the profile, they will not invest. The hard truth is this: 90% of all files that VC look at are simply not worth investing in (lofty ideas, me too ideas, \u201cwe are going to change the galaxy\u201d\u2026but overlooking market forces, even basis demand forces\u2026and no execution plan\u201d)\u2026.even more so 99% of \u201centrepreneurs\u201d are not worthy of an investments (and that where it really hurts the ego of some folks). \u201cEntrepreneur\u201d has become some kind of lifestyle status. It really isn\u2019t. And never should be. As an advisor to startups and growing companies, I can attest to the fact that most \u201centrepreneurs\u201d have no real idea about what it takes, day in and day out, to build a successful company. And even less of an idea to build a company that is worth the attention and $$ of a VC. Most entrepreneurs believe they can replicate the very few high visibility successes because\u2026well, because what exactly?  \u201cWe are going to make you rich investing in the stock market because we have a magic formula and an iPhone app\u201d\u2026.seriously, Do you really understand how the stock market works? Do you really understand the negative winds a retail investor is facing when trying to make money on the stock market? and do you really believe that you can negate all those forces with your app? Really? And you want VCs to believe you?  Like I said, 90% of ideas are not worth funding. And 99% of people pitching these ideas are not worth funding. That gives you VC statistics! It\u2019s eloquent and accurate. (Exaggerations and shortcuts are based on a literary style that works well in the original language (French) which Julien used in his previous m\u00e9tier.)  To speak more precisely, let\u2019s redefine the lie as more of a social myth perpetrated by everyone altogether, and certainly not by any individual VC. I hope my own reputation is as one who avoids wasting anyone\u2019s time. Thank you Julien! \u201cSo, unless you come from money, attended a prestigious university in the States or sold your previous startups for a lot of money, you should assume that you\u2019re never going to raise early-stage capital.\u201d I have to strongly disagree Julien. I\u2019d rather put it as: \u201cUnless you are an extremely strong entrepreneur, with a well-balanced team and have a very solid idea that can scale it is unlikely you will raise early-stage capital\u201d. There is a strong competition! No one will offer an investment to someone simply because they want to be an entrepreneur and have an \u201cok\u201d idea. Until you have seen first-hand the number and caliber of entrepreneurs in Montreal and Canada by meeting meaningfully 100+ of them, I believe it would be very difficult without data to make such an assessment. Yes elite universities (or employers) and previous success is often attractive to VCs. It is because it often correlates (not always) with being an extremely strong entrepreneur.  In my time as a VC, we probably invested just as often (if not more) in unproven entrepreneurs without a very prestigious name to their resume\u2026 but they all were extremely strong entrepreneurs. Portraying the pretty large number of Canadian entrepreneurs who don\u2019t have previous exits or a degree from an Ivy League but that did raise money, as only a \u201cfairy-tale\u201d is at best uninformed\u2026 and at worst a bitter claim from someone rationalizing their own failure.  At the end of the day, if you are a very strong entrepreneur with a world-class team, with an idea that can really change the game, you should be able to find capital in a place like Montreal. It\u2019s easy to blame the system, what\u2019s harder is to look in the mirror and recognize that you and your team are not world-class yet or that your idea is not that special or scalable. I do however agree with two things you stated:\n1. If you are a first-time entrepreneur with limited experience, participating in a strong and proven accelerator is an excellent path\n2. You shouldn\u2019t focus all your energy on raising capital early-on but on building your business, learning and proving your model. This is especially true if your idea is not THAT original and strong, and if you don\u2019t have previous successes that can give a lot of confidence to investors that you will deliver. I\u2019ll leave with this final thought. There is something obvious but often overlooked: not all VCs and investors are equal and they shouldn\u2019t be lumped in all the same boat. There are bad VCs (highly biased, focused mainly on the financial and legal aspect of a deal, in it for themselves, etc.), there are good VCs (good at evaluating talent and idea, focused on the business and how to bring value, in it for the entrepreneurs, etc.) and everything in-between. Accurate and honest. Thank you Julien. Your metaphor exaggerations and shortcuts seem to me a translation of your classic style which works well in French. I saw it in Le Journal Les Affaires for many years.  Crowdfunding solves two problems: getting first love from clients-users, and first love from wellwishers-backers. You\u2019re on the right track imho. Thanks for writing this perspective because VC has to build itself up and market itself even when, or especially when, the chances of getting early-stage funding is very low. From looking at the startups in Canada, you can see that they fund things themselves, or more likely, depend on whatever government grants they can find. And of course, the same \u201crich get richer\u201d perspective applies. If you already had funding, or already have connections, or went to a top university, you\u2019re already plugged into the funding network and are way more likely to raise early-stage funding. For everyone else, you have to stop buying into the \u201cbig lie\u201d as Julien puts it, and put in the hard work to find customers, listen to their feedback, build a better product, and figure out a marketing & sales strategy. This may reduce the scope of what you can actually build, but that\u2019s much more sustainable and less stressful than trying to chase early-stage funding dollars which your startup is very unlikely to get.

While the company believes the car\u2019s suite of sensors spotted 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg as she crossed the road in front of the modified Volvo XC90 on March 18th, two sources tell the publication that the software was tuned in such a way that it \u201cdecided\u201d it didn\u2019t need to take evasive action, and possibly flagged the detection as a \u201cfalse positive.\u201d  The reason a system would do this, according to the report, is because there are a number of situations where the computers that power an autonomous car might see something it thinks is a human or some other obstacle. Uber reportedly set that threshold so low, though, that the system saw a person crossing the road with a bicycle and determined that immediate evasive action wasn\u2019t necessary. While Uber had an operator, or \u201csafety driver,\u201d in the car who was supposed to be able to take control in a failure like this, the employee was seen glancing down in the moments before the crash in footage released by the Tempe Police Department.   All of Uber\u2019s self-driving testing efforts have been suspended since the accident, and the company is still working with the National Transportation Safety Board, which has yet to issue a preliminary report on the progress that\u2019s been made in its investigation. When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Uber issued the same statement to The Verge that is found in The Information\u2019s story:  We\u2019re actively cooperating with the NTSB in their investigation. Out of respect for that process and the trust we\u2019ve built with NTSB, we can\u2019t comment on the specifics of the incident. In the meantime, we have initiated a top-to-bottom safety review of our self-driving vehicles program, and we have brought on former NTSB Chair Christopher Hart to advise us on our overall safety culture. Our review is looking at everything from the safety of our system to our training processes for vehicle operators, and we hope to have more to say soon. In the wake of the crash, signs have emerged that Uber\u2019s self-driving program was potentially fraught with risk. For one thing, Uber had reduced the number of \u201csafety drivers\u201d in its test cars from two to one, according to a New York Times report. This explained why the driver who was in the car that killed Herzberg was alone.  Then in late March, Reuters discovered that Uber had reduced the number of LIDAR sensors on its test cars. (LIDAR is considered by most to be critical hardware for autonomous driving.) All this was happening in an environment with little oversight from the government in Arizona. Emails obtained by The Guardian in the weeks after the crash detailed a cozy relationship between Uber and Arizona Governor Doug Ducey that may have allowed the company\u2019s test cars to hit the road even earlier than previously thought.   Many of Uber\u2019s competitors, and even some of its partners, have spoken out since the accident as the company tried to find an answer for what went wrong. Nvidia, which supplies the GPUs that help power Uber\u2019s autonomous tech, distanced itself in late March and said the fault must have been with Uber\u2019s software. Velodyne, which makes the LIDAR sensor that Uber uses, says its tech shouldn\u2019t have been affected by the nighttime conditions. Intel\u2019s Mobileye division published a breakdown of how and why its tech would have recognized Herzberg, though now that doesn\u2019t seem to have been the problem according to The Information\u2019s report.  Despite Herzberg\u2019s death, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi \u2014 who The New York Times recently reported had considered ending the self-driving program when he came on board last August \u2014 said in an April interview with the Today show that the company is \u201cabsolutely committed to self-driving cars.\u201d     Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future.","time":1525723762,"title":"Uber Thinks Its Self-Driving Car Killed Because It \u2018Decided\u2019 Not to Swerve","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/5\/7\/17327682\/uber-self-driving-car-decision-kill-swerve","label":7,"label_name":"random"},{"by":"jonbaer","descendants":1,"id":17015910,"kids":"[17018520]","score":7,"text":"\u2018We\u2019ve fallen off a cliff: very little sea ice remains in the Bering Sea\u2019 Almost all the ice covering the\u00a0Bering Sea\u00a0has melted, scientists have confirmed, throwing communities living around its shores into disarray. The region\u2019s ice cover normally persists for at least another month, and this year it has vanished earlier than any other year except 2017. Located in the northern Pacific Ocean between Alaska and Russia, the Bering Sea is experiencing the brunt of climate change and has already drawn attention this year for unprecedented levels of winter melting. In February, soaring Arctic temperatures led to around half the region\u2019s ice disappearing in the space of two weeks. This trend has continued into spring, and scientists have confirmed that by the end of April just 10 per cent of normal ice levels remained. \u201cWe\u2019ve fallen off a cliff: very little sea ice remains in the Bering Sea,\u201d tweeted Dr Rick Thoman, a climatologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,\u00a0who is based in Alaska. A report released by the International Arctic Research Centre at the University of Alaska Fairbanks\u00a0has outlined the real-world effects of these stunning environmental changes on the many communities that inhabit the Bering Sea region. \u201cThe low sea ice is already impacting the lives and livelihoods of people in western Alaska coastal communities by restricting hunting and fishing, which are the mainstays of the economies of these communities,\u201d Dr Thoman told The Washington Post. We\u2019ve fallen off a cliff: very little sea ice remains in the Bering Sea. From @NSIDC data, ice extent fell below 10% of the 1981-2010 average max extent on April 23, four weeks earlier than any other spring except last year. #akwx #Arctic @Climatologist49 @ZLabe @lisashefguy pic.twitter.com\/ShQYDZL5Jf \u201cTravel between communities via boat or snowmachine was difficult and limited due to thin, unstable sea ice,\u201d the report said. \u201cAt times there was not enough ice to harvest marine mammals, fish\u00a0or crabs. As a result of increased open water, storm surf flooded homes and pushed ice rubble onto shore. The lack of sea ice in recent months has exposed these communities to the elements, as it normally acts as a buttress against extreme weather events. A large late February storm devastated Little Diomede Island, leading to a loss of power for inhabitants as ice rubble covered the local helipad and damaged the water treatment plant.

West of Savoonga in the town of Gambell, the lack of sea ice led to a lack of walrus traditionally found in the area. The drivers behind the premature melting of the Bering Sea\u2019s ice include both long-term global warming and an unfortunate confluence of weather events. According to Dr Brian Brettschneider, a climate scientist with the International Arctic Research Centre, \u201cthe warmed state of the Arctic has primed the region for low ice values\u201d.\u00a0 Readings taken across the region have confirmed that both ocean and air temperatures were well above normal in the months leading up to and during the melting events of this year. These high temperatures have been exacerbated by air currents over the Arctic guiding storms into the region and drawing warmer air from the tropics. The storms prevented ice from forming properly by breaking it up before it became stable. The amount of sea ice in the Bering Sea was lower this winter than any year since whaling vessels began keeping written records in 1850. In their\u00a0report, the International Arctic Research Centre scientists wrote that while not every year will be as bad as this one, ice formation is likely to remain low if the Bering Sea\u2019s waters remain warm.\u00a0 They also warn that communities will need to \u201cprepare for more winters with low sea ice and stormy conditions\u201d. \u201cFellow Americans are suffering from a natural disaster,\u201d said Dr Thoman.\u00a0\u201cWhile low sea ice is not as dramatic as a wildfire or an Interstate 95 snowstorm, the impacts and hardships it produces are just as real.\u201d We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

Generally this is under \/usr\/libexec\/sudo (on\nmacOS hosts it's \/usr\/local\/libexec\/sudo). An appropriate approval\nscript must be installed into the PATH.

The plugin can be provided several options to modify its behavior. These\noptions are provided to the plugin by adding them to the end of the\nPlugin line in \/etc\/sudo.conf. Example: The full list of options are as follows: binary_path (default: \/usr\/bin\/sudo_approve) This is the location of the approval binary. The approval command itself needs to run under the privileges of the destination user or group, and this is done so using sudo, so it must be exempted from requiring its own pair approval. user_prompt_path (default: \/etc\/sudo_pair.prompt.user) This is the location of the prompt template to display to the user invoking sudo; if no template is found at this location, an extremely minimal default will be printed. See the Prompts section for more details. pair_prompt_path (default: \/etc\/sudo_pair.prompt.pair) This is the location of the prompt template to display to the user being asked to approve the sudo session; if no template is found at this location, an extremely minimal default will be printed. See the Prompts section for more details. socket_dir (default: \/var\/run\/sudo_pair) This is the path where this plugin will store sockets for sessions that are pending approval. This directory must be owned by root and only writable by root, or the plugin will abort. gids_enforced (default: 0) This is a comma-separated list of gids that sudo_pair will gate access to. If a user is sudoing to a user that is a member of one of these groups, they will be required to have a pair approve their session. gids_exempted (default: none) This is a comma-separated list of gids whose users will be exempted from the requirements of sudo_pair. Note that this is not the opposite of the gids_enforced flag. Whereas gids_enforced gates access to groups, gids_exempted exempts users sudoing from groups. For instance, this setting can be used to ensure that oncall sysadmins can respond to outages without needing to find a pair. Note that root is always exempt. This plugin allows you to configure the prompts that are displayed to\nboth users being asked to find a pair and users being asked to approve\nanother user's sudo session. If prompts aren't\nconfigured (or can't be found on the filesystem),\nextremely minimal ones are provided as a default. The contents of the prompt files are raw bytes that should be printed to\nthe user's terminal. This allows fun things like terminal processing of\nANSI escape codes for coloration, resizing terminals, and setting window\ntitles, all of which are (ab)used in the sample prompts provided. These prompts also implement a simple %-escaped\ntemplating language. Any known directive preceded by a % character is\nreplaced by an expansion, and anything else is treated as a literal\n(e.g., %% is a literal %, and %a is a literal a). Available expansions: The provided approval script is just a small\n(but complete) example. As much functionality as possible has been moved\ninto the plugin, with one (important, temporary) exception: currently,\nthe script must verify that the user approving a sudo session is not\nthe user who is requesting the session. Other than that, the only thing required of the \"protocol\" is to: As it turns out, you can pretty much just do this with socat: The script incldued with this project isn't much more than this. It\nperforms a few extra niceties (implicitly sudos if necessary, turns\noff terminal echo, disables Ctrl-C, and kills the session on Ctrl-D),\nbut not much more. Ctrl-C was disabled so a user who's forgotten that\nthis is terminal is being used to monitor another user's session doesn't\ninstinctively kill it with Ctrl-C. Sessions under sudo_pair can't be used in the middle of a pipe. I'll\nconsider lifting these restrictions, but doing so is inherently\nproblematic. Allowing piped data to standard input, as far as I can tell, likel\nresults in a complete bypass of the security model here. Commands can\noften accept input on stdin, and there's no reasonable way to show\nthis information to the pair. On the other hand, if sudo output is piped to stdout, we could\nsimply log it like we log TTY output. This works, except we print the\nprompt itself on stdout. We could print the prompt to stderr\ninstead. In retrospect, maybe we should do this. Redirecting to stderr\nwould still be problematic, but at least we get some ability to insert\nsudo commands at the front of pipes. I'll consider this. This plugin allows users to sudo -u ${user} to become a user or\nsudo -g ${group} to gain an additional group. When a user does this, a socket is created that is owned and only\nwritable by ${user} (or ${group}). In order to connect to that\nsocket, the approver must be able to write to files as that ${user}\n(or ${group}). In other words, they need to be on the other side of\nthe airtight hatchway. In practical terms, this\nmeans the approver needs to also be able to sudo to that user or\ngroup. To facilitate this, the plugin exempts the approval script from the\nrequirement to have a pair. And the sample approval script automatically\ndetects the user or group you need to become and runs sudo -u ${user}\n(or sudo -g ${group}) implicitly. As a concrete example, these are the sockets opened for sudo -u root,\nsudo -u nobody, and sudo -g sys: The only people who can approve a sudo session to a user or group must\nalso be able to sudo as that user or group. Due to limitations of the POSIX filesystem permission model, a user may\nsudo to a new user (and gain its groups) or sudo to a new group\n(preserving their current user), but not both simultaneously.

Co-Author of \"Docker: Up and Running\" from O'Reilly Media. Dublin, Ireland.  Twitter  Google+  Github  We needed a specialized load balancer at Nitro. After\nsome study, Mihai Todor and I built a\nsolution that leverages Nginx, the Redis protocol, and a Go-based request\nrouter where Nginx does all the heavy lifting and the router carries no traffic\nitself. This solution has worked great in production for the last year. Here\u2019s\nwhat we did and why we did it. The new service we were building would be behind a pool of load balancers and\nwas going to do some expensive calculations\u2014and therefore do some local\ncaching.  To optimize for the cache, we wanted to try to send requests for the\nsame resources to the same host if it were available. There are a number of off-the-shelf ways to solve this problem. A\nnon-exhaustive list of possibilities includes: Go Gopher by Renee French. This service will be hit several times per page load and so HTTP redirects are\nnot viable for performance reasons. The rest of those solutions all work well\nif all the inbound requests are passing through the same load balancer. If, on\nthe other hand, your frontend is a pool of load balancers, you need to be able\nto either share state between them or implement more sophisticated routing\nlogic. We weren\u2019t interested in the design changes needed to share state\nbetween load balancers at the moment and so opted for more sophisticated\nrouting logic for this service. It probably helps to understand our motiviation a little better to understand a\nbit about our architecture. We have a pool of frontend load balancers and instances of the service are\ndeployed on Mesos so they may come and go depending on scale and resource\navailability. Getting a list of hosts and ports into the load balancer is not\nan issue, that\u2019s already core to our platform. Because everything is running on Mesos, and we have a simple way to define and\ndeploy services, adding any new service is a\ntrivial task. On top of Mesos, we run gossip-based\nSidecar everywhere to manage service\ndiscovery. Our frontend load balancers are Lyft\u2019s\nEnvoy backed by Sidecar\u2019s Envoy integration. For most\nservices that is enough. The Envoy hosts run on dedicated instances but the\nservices all move between hosts as needed, directed by Mesos and the\nSingularity scheduler. The Mesos nodes for the service under consideration here would have disks for local\ncaching. Looking at the problem we decided we really wanted a consistent hash ring. We\ncould have nodes come and go as needed and only the requests being served by\nthose nodes would be re-routed. All the remaining nodes would continue to serve\nany open sessions. We could easily back the consistent hash ring with data from\nSidecar (you could substitute Mesos or K8s here). Sidecar health checks nodes\nand so we could rely on nodes being available if they are alive in Sidecar. We needed to then somehow bolt the consistent hash to something that could\ndirect traffic to the right node. It would need to receive each request,\nidentify the resource in question, and then pass the request to the exact\ninstance of the service that was prepped to handle that resource. Of course, the resource identification is easily handled by a URL and any load\nbalancer can take those apart to handle simple routing. So we just needed to tie\nthat to the consistent hash and we\u2019d have a solution. You could do this in Lua in Nginx, possibly in HAproxy with Lua as well. No one\nat Nitro is a Lua expert and libraries to implement the pieces we needed were\nnot obviously available. Ideally the routing logic would be in Go, which is\nalready a critical language in our stack and well supported. Nginx has a rich ecosystem, though, and a little thinking outside the box\nturned up a couple of interesting Nginx plugins, however. The first of these is\nthe nginx-eval-module by\nValery Kholodkov. This allows you to make a call from Nginx to an endpoint and\nthen evaluate the result into an Nginx variable. Among other possible uses, the\nsignificance of that for us is that it allows you to dynamically decide which\nendpoint should receive a proxy-pass. That\u2019s what we wanted to do. You make a\ncall from Nginx to somewhere, you get a result, and then your make a routing\ndecision based on that value. You could implement the recipient of that request with an HTTP service that\nreturns only a string with the hostname and port of the destination service\nendpoint. That service would maintain the consistent hash and then tell Nginx\nwhere to route the traffic for each request. But making a separate HTTP\nrequest, even if were always contained on the same node, is a bit heavy. The\nwhole expected body of the reply would be something like the string\n10.10.10.5:23453. With HTTP, we\u2019d be passing headers in both directions that\nwould vastly exceed the size of the response. So I started to look at other protocols supported by Nginx. Memcache protocol\nand Redis protocol are both supported. Of those, the best supported from a Go\nservice is Redis. So that was where we turned. There are two Redis modules for Nginx. One of them is suitable for use with the\nnginx-eval-module. The best Go library for Redis is\nRedeo. It implements a really simple handler\nmechanism much like the stdlib http package. Any Redis procotol command will\ninvoke a handler function, and they are really simple to write. Alas, it only\nsupports a newer Redis protocol than the Nginx plugin can handle. So, I dusted\noff my C skills and patched the Nginx\nplugin to use the newest Redis\nprotocol encoding. So the solution we ended up with is: The call comes in from the Internet, hits an Envoy node, then an Nginx node.\nThe Nginx node (1) asks the router where to send it, and then (2) Nginx passes\nthe request to the endpoint. We built a library in Go to manage our consistent hash backed by Sidecar or by Hashicorp\u2019s Memberlist library. We called that library Ringman. We then bolted that libary into a service which serves Redis protocol requests via Redeo. Only two Redis commands are required: GET and SELECT. We chose to implement a few more commands for debugging purposes, including INFO which can reply with any server state you\u2019d like. Of the two required commands, we can safely ignore SELECT, which is for selecting the Redis DB to use for any subsequent calls. We just accept it and do nothing.GET, which does all the work, was easy to implement. Here\u2019s the entire function to serve the Ringman endpoint over Redis with Redeo. Nginx passes the URL it received, and we return the endpoint from the hash ring. That is called by Nginx using the following config: We deploy Nginx and the router in containers and they run on the same hosts\nso we have a very low call overhead between them. We build Nginx like this: We\u2019ve tested the performance of this extensively and in our environment we see\nabout 0.2-0.3ms response times on average for a round trip from Nginx to the Go\nrouter over Redis protocol. Since the median response time from the upstream\nservice is about 70ms, this is a negligeable delay. A more complex Nginx config might be able to do more sophisticated error handling.\nReliability after a year in service is extremly good and performance has been\nconstant. If you have a similar need, you can re-use most of the components. Just follow\nthe links above to actual source code. If you are interested in adding support\nfor K8s or Mesos directly to Ringman, that would be welcome. This solution started out sounding a bit like a hack and in the end has been a\ngreat addition to our infrastructure. Hopefully it helps someone else solve a\nsimilar problem.

With namespaces, multiple packages could use the same class and function names without conflict, because each one would operate in their own PHP namespaces: Since that code lives within the SteveGrunwell\\PackageA\u00a0namespace (as declared at the top of the file), I could use the code seamlessly next to: While both packages define a do_something()\u00a0function, the functions from Package A and Package B exist in different PHP namespaces (SteveGrunwell\\PackageA\u00a0and SteveGrunwell\\PackageB, respectively). Conventionally, PHP namespaces will follow the pattern of {vendor}\\{package}, such as SteveGrunwell\\PackageA\u00a0in the examples above. If you\u2019re working as part of a development or product team, you might also consider nesting namespaces (for example, some things I\u2019ll build as an engineer on the Managed WordPress (MWP) product at Liquid Web might live under the LiquidWeb\\MWP\\{package}\u00a0PHP namespace. Nesting namespaces can be a really useful feature, especially when you\u2019re dealing with lots of similar functionality. For example, my Schemify plugin uses PHP namespaces (and autoloading, which is a topic all in itself). Here\u2019s an excerpt from the Schemify\\Schemas\\CreativeWork\u00a0class: Since I wanted to separate the individual schema definitions from the rest of the plugin code, I put them in the Schemify\\Schemas\u00a0namespace (Schemify doesn\u2019t currently use a vendor namespace, so the main plugin code is in Schemify\u00a0instead of SteveGrunwell\\Schemify). To call these functions\u00a0from within the same namespace, we can simply reference the function by name; if I added a do_something_else()\u00a0function within the SteveGrunwell\\PackageA\u00a0namespace, I can simply call do_something()\u00a0and it\u2019s implied that I\u2019m referencing SteveGrunwell\\PackageA\\do_something(). If we need to call functions in\u00a0different namespaces, we can do it in a few different ways: First, we can reference the function name prefixed with the full PHP namespace That\u2019s probably my least favorite way to use namespaces, but is perfectly valid (especially if you\u2019re only referencing the function from Package A once or twice. Next, we can import code from other PHP namespaces into the current namespace via the use\u00a0keyword: Finally, we can import the specific functions we need into the current namespace via\u00a0use function\u00a0(note: this is only available in PHP 5.6 or newer): Each of these approaches is valid and has good use-cases, producing the same result. Where PHP namespaces become\u00a0really handy are when we\u2019re dealing with object-oriented programming (OOP). Instead of dealing with importing specific functions, we can tell PHP \u201cwhen I reference a given class name, I\u2019m referring to this specific class.\u201d Let\u2019s say I\u2019m writing my own WP-CLI command, which I\u2019ll put in the SteveGrunwell\\MyCommand\u00a0namespace: If I were to try to load my command just like that, PHP would give me an error to the effect of \u201cClass SteveGrunwell\\MyCommand\\WP_CLI_Command does not exist\u201d, because the WP_CLI_Command\u00a0class is defined in the\u00a0global namespace (in other words, is not namespaced). I can solve this by adding a single import to my file: With that use\u00a0statement in place, PHP will now understand that SteveGrunwell\\MyCommand\\Command\u00a0extends WP_CLI_Command, which lives in the global PHP namespace. Now that we have a basic understanding of what PHP namespaces are and how to use them, let\u2019s take a look at namespaces from a WordPress perspective: I\u2019ve written a bit about this before, but in the early days of WordPress development, plugin developers might write a function that looks like this: However, the developer might find that another theme or plugin \u2014 or even WordPress core itself \u2014 introduces a get_recent_posts()\u00a0function, which then causes the site to break because PHP has received two separate declarations of a get_recent_posts()\u00a0function. To get around this, developers started prefixing their function names with their theme\/plugin slug or another unique identifier; get_recent_posts()\u00a0might become myplugin_get_recent_posts(). Suddenly, the chances of a name collision dropped, but function names would get longer and longer. Developers with multiple plugins might find themselves adding vendor names, resulting in functions like grunwell_myplugin_get_recent_posts(), which made the code harder to read. Next, some enterprising developers thought \u201cwait a second, why don\u2019t we just encapsulate everything in classes?\u201d, so we ended up with classes that looked something like this: As a result, developers would need to instantiate (e.g. create an instance of) these classes, so we often ended up with messy global variable declarations:  From here, developers seem to have split into two factions: the first, dead-set on removing global variables, moved toward the Singleton pattern: Some plugins (such as WooCommerce) took it a step further, and hid some of the get_instance()\u00a0ugliness in an easily-referenced function: Unfortunately, the Singleton pattern makes testing a bit of a bear and doesn\u2019t\u00a0really eliminate globals (while the global\u00a0keyword isn\u2019t used, you\u2019re still storing a single reference to an object in a globally-static class property. The second group of developers recognized that these plugins were rarely being handled as true objects, instead being used as\u00a0pseudo-namespaces \u2014 constructs to encapsulate code from global namespace collisions without using true PHP namespaces. However, since WordPress still (at the time of this writing) supports PHP 5.2 (which lacks PHP namespace support), developers trying to reach the broadest possible audience still needed a way to reasonably encapsulate their code without relying on (or having to learn, depending on who you ask) PHP namespaces. The result was a class full of static methods, acting as a more-responsible pseudo-namespace: The 10up Engineering Best Practices (disclosure: I\u2019ve contributed to those documents) does a great job of outlining common cases for this approach. Since the methods are static, we\u2019re not creating rogue objects\u00a0or abusing globals, but we\u2019re still throwing code that likely doesn\u2019t need to be object-oriented into classes; it\u2019s a \u201cit\u2019s an ugly hack, but it\u2019s the least ugly of the ugly hacks\u201d approach.  Now that we\u2019re up-to-speed, let\u2019s take a look at that original get_recent_posts()\u00a0function and see how we can get it working with PHP namespaces: Can you spot the differences between this function and our original example? If not, I\u2019ll give you a hint: it\u2019s literally two lines at the top of the file, starting with namespace\u00a0and use. By adding the namespace declaration to the top of the file (and importing the WP_Query\u00a0class from the global namespace, since our function uses it), we\u2019re able to write clean, well-encapsulated code. One of the challenges I see when developers run into when learning to use namespaces within WordPress is the WordPress Plugin API (e.g. actions and filters). When working with functions in the global namespace, hooking into an action might look like this: Likewise, calling methods inside a class often look like one of the following: Fortunately, hooking callbacks that live within PHP namespaces looks much more like the first example: If you\u2019re referencing a callback function in the same (or a child) namespace, you may also use the __NAMESPACE__\u00a0PHP magic constant: When hooking into namespaced callbacks, remember the leading backslashes! It\u2019s hard to definitively say that\u00a0every WordPress plugin should be using PHP namespaces, but it\u2019s really easy to make the case that\u00a0the majority of them should. According to WordPress.org, less than 4% (3.1%, at the time of this writing) of WordPress installations are running on PHP 5.2, and there are well-supported efforts within the community to drop support for PHP 5.2. Put bluntly,\u00a0there\u2019s no reason to continue to support WordPress sites running PHP 5.2. However, if you\u2019re building a plugin or theme that\u00a0might be installed by users running PHP 5.2, you might consider the following approach: make your main plugin file (e.g. my-plugin\/my-plugin.php) act as a bootstrap for the rest of the plugin, and include a check for older versions of PHP. The result might look something like this:  Hopefully this crash-course in PHP namespaces has helped to demystify the topic, especially for PHP developers who focus mainly on WordPress. A strong understanding of PHP namespaces will not only help you better structure and encapsulate your code, but will also make it\u00a0much easier to understand other projects written using more modern PHP methodologies. Tags: Namespaces, PHP, WordPress I maintain two WordPress plugins and one of the things that have held me back from catching up with the latest PHP features (namespaces, closures, and surely a ton of other things) is precisely the fact that WordPress still supports PHP 5.2 (the other is a bit of laziness, I must admit). Nonetheless, I\u2019ve been keeping an eye on WordPress\u2019 usage stats for a few months now and I\u2019m thrilled to see that most people are running WP 4.6 or newer (around 80% of the sites last time I checked) and it should be safe to use namespaces now as well because -like you said- only a small fraction of the sites out there are still running PHP 5.2. Hopefully the WordPress team will finally drop support for PHP 5.2 in the near future, although I\u2019m probably not going to wait that long. TLDR; Thanks for the reminder! What\u2019s even better is that between the \u201cRequires PHP\u201d header in the WordPress.org plugin readme.txt file and efforts like Serve Happy, it\u2019s becoming even easier to say \u201cif you want the advanced functionality that comes from my plugin, you need to be on a (semi-) recent version of PHP. If not, you have bigger problems than whether or not your site has X feature.\u201d Thanks for reading and the kind words! This post is tremendously helpful Steve, thank you very much for putting it together! One thing I\u2019m wondering about (as somebody whose day job sometimes includes reading, but usually not writing PHP) is the use of backslashes to reference back to the global namespace. To modify one of your examples above: Would that work as well?\nIs there an advantage in using use instead of backslashes, aside from that it arguably looks better and makes the code more readable? I noticed the Drupal documentation on namespaces goes so far to discourage use for global classes and interfaces: Classes and interfaces without a backslash \\ inside their fully-qualified name (for example, the built-in PHP Exception class) must be fully qualified when used in a namespaced file. For example: new \\Exception();. Do not use global classes. Is there any scenario where you\u2019d recommend using backslashes instead of use, and if so, why? Hey Caspar, thanks for reading! Your modified example (with class Command extends \\WP_CLI_Command) is functionally equivalent, so it\u2019s something of a matter of personal preference. I definitely appreciate you linking to the Drupal docs on the matter, however, since I had not come across them before. Upon closer reading, it seems that the Drupal coding standards are stating \u201cdon\u2019t use built-in (global) PHP classes, use leading backslashes instead.\u201d This is also consistent with the examples in the official PSR-2 spec: In that example, ArrayAccess and Countable are both preceded by backslashes, but the other classes that aren\u2019t built-into PHP are explicitly imported via use statements. I think this makes a lot of sense, and helps demarcate native PHP functionality from code being defined locally or via packages. Great question, thank you! Hello Steve, Great article!

It doesn\u2019t sound\nso good, does it? We\u2019ve just taken it out of storage and it\u2019s all out of tune...\n Tune the guitar using the tuner. Click and drag the tuning\nknobs on the right to tighten and loosen the strings. \nThis doesn\u2019t sound in tune quite yet. Scroll back up and try to get all of the tuning knobs to turn green. Guitars generate noise through the vibration of their strings. On an electric guitar such as this one,\nmagnetic \u201cpick-ups\u201d convert those vibrations into an electrical signal which can then be sent to a tuner or an amplifier. This signal can be visualized as a raw waveform, but\noften we want to visualize the frequency instead. The fourier transform is a mathematical function\nthat reveals the audio frequencies hidden in that wave. Strum the guitar to see the frequency\nvisualized. Now that we\u2019ve tuned the guitar using a tuner, let\u2019s try to tune the guitar by ear.\nThis is more challenging, and it may take you time to master. We\u2019ll start by tuning to a reference note. When you manipulate the tuners on the\nright the current note will be played, as will a reference note. This will be easier with a cleaner sound. Match the two\nsounds to get the guitar in tune. Most of the strings on a guitar are separated by an interval known as a perfect fourth. The perfect fourth is beautifully resonant, but there\u2019s one pair of strings on a guitar which are not separated by a perfect fourth. The interval between the  GGG  and  BBB  strings is a major third. The major third sounds happy and uplifting.  Learning to hear these intervals will help you tune your guitar without a tuner.  \nWhen two strings are played together, they produce a third higher frequency known as an overtone. When the two strings are not perfectly in tune, the overtone is inconsistent over time. This produces a wobbling, a beat, in the overtone which you can hear if you listen carefully. Play notes with a 5.00 Hz difference: As you get a pair of strings closer in tune, the beats will slow down until the overtone is perfectly amplified.\nListening for the slowing of these beats is a helpful cue for tuning. Try tuning the guitar by listening for the relationships between adjacent strings and the beats in the resultant overtone.

Self-driving cars are no longer a futuristic AI technology. They\u2019re here, and will soon make transportation cheaper and more convenient. The team at Drive.ai has been working closely with local partners to ensure the deployment of our cars is safe and adds real value to its day-to-day users. Providing a public self-driving car service depends on three key elements: Self-driving technology is still challenging. It requires highly skilled AI teams as well as sophisticated software and hardware architectures. Drive.ai has always had a strong technical team; its founders include many AI graduate students from my group at Stanford University as well as Carol Reiley (my spouse). Comprised of deep learning natives, the team has designed a self-driving architecture using modern AI from the ground up. Further, by developing the full software stack for self-driving in-house\u200a\u2014\u200a-perception, motion planning, mapping, localization, fleet management software, mobile app, communications, our \u201ctele-choice\u201d remote assistance system, and more\u200a\u2014\u200athe team is able to move quickly and resolve any dependencies between systems. Self-driving cars should be deployed in geofenced areas in partnership with governments and private parties to ensure safe, smooth operations that add value to its day-to-day users As a skilled AI team, Drive.ai has a clear-eyed view of AI\u2019s limitations. The team knows how to build realistic solutions within the current technology\u2019s limitations. For example, no self-driving team has a realistic roadmap to reliably interpret the hand gestures of a construction worker waving for a car to proceed; computer vision just isn\u2019t good enough yet. Thus, we are partnering with governments and private parties to deploy in geofenced regions, where we can find other ways for construction workers to communicate with our fleet operations team. Drive.ai is particularly grateful to Frisco\u2019s Mayor Jeff Cheney, Frisco TMA, and NCTCOG\u2019s Michael Morris for their partnership. Working together, our initial pilot will be a six month deployment on a driving route from HALL Park to an entertainment\/retail area (The Star), with a planned expansion into Frisco Station. Deploying local on-demand shuttle routes benefits everyone. Office workers can grab lunch without having to drive and look for parking, and local business owners can attract more customers. A self-driving service will boost local commerce, reduce traffic jams, and lessen the need for parking lots. We also aim to unlock access to areas underserved by traditional mass transit and improve connectivity to existing transit lines. Thoughtful self-driving deployments can increase mass transit ridership and reduce individual car usage, thus driving down a city\u2019s transportation costs. The industry must take a human-centered approach to safety\u200a\u2014\u200ataking into account both people inside and outside the car\u200a\u2014\u200aand emphasize communications and community education. Whether a self-driving car is safe depends not only on the behavior of the car itself, but also on the behavior of the people around it. It is unwise to rely exclusively on AI technology to ensure safety. Instead, the self-driving industry also has to think about the people who will be outside the vehicle, which is why we will be undertaking community-wide education and training programs where we operate. It is every self-driving company\u2019s responsibility to ensure safety. We believe the self-driving car industry should adopt these practices: We deliberately prioritized recognizability over beauty, since it is recognizability that enhances safety. In the first phase, Drive.ai will deploy vehicles with safety drivers in Texas. We are also deploying our \u201ctele-choice\u201d technology to provide a high level of safety and ride comfort. For example, say our vehicle wants to execute a tricky maneuver at an intersection. If it determines that it needs human insight for an additional layer of safety, it will first pull to a stop, then seek input from a remote operator to proceed. Over time, our deep learning system learns from these cases and improves automatically. Unlike \u201cremote driving,\u201d where a tele-choice operator controls the car directly, our tele-choice system is designed to be robust to network latency and temporary network outages, taking into account even small edge cases like automatically invalidating stale data or requests lagging by 100 ms. In the second phase, when road tests show it is safe to do so, Drive.ai will operate with \u201cchaperones\u201d (rather than safety drivers) alongside tele-choice operators. The chaperone will sit in a passenger seat and be available to assist passengers and monitor operations, but they will not be expected to take over in a split-second. In the final phase, we will operate with only passengers in the vehicle, assisted remotely by tele-choice operators. One tele-choice operator will be able to monitor multiple vehicles, thus enabling more scalable deployments of self-driving. There is still much work to be done, but the future of self-driving is clear. Self-driving cars have different strengths and weaknesses than human drivers. They are always attentive, have <100 ms reaction times, and have no blind spots. On the flip side, they don\u2019t understand certain complex situations such as a construction worker communicating using hand gestures. By choosing geofenced regions and working with partners, we can take advantage of self-driving cars\u2019 strengths while diminishing their weaknesses. With these strategies, the self-driving industry will be able to deploy safe and valuable transportation services. I remember attending the DARPA Urban Challenge in 2007 and seeing the wonderful work of Stanford University, CMU, and many other pioneering self-driving teams. Our work builds on that rich legacy. It is now over a decade later. I am thrilled that self-driving cars are finally here. To learn more about Drive.ai\u2019s work to advance self-driving, head to drive.ai.

We bring together the best of the edge and cloud to deliver Azure services anywhere in your environment.  Learn more  Posted on May 7, 2018 With Kubernetes exploding in popularity worldwide, it\u2019s no surprise that Kubernetes usage on Azure has grown more than 10x over the last year. Customers love the agility, reliability, and scalability benefits provided by container orchestrators like Kubernetes. Early reviews of our AKS, our managed Kubernetes service, demonstrate serious interest from customers of all shapes and sizes. For Build 2018, we\u2019re thrilled to announce some big improvements to the Kubernetes experience on Azure. To start, our managed Kubernetes service has been renamed to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). AKS is now officially part of the Kubernetes Conformance Program, designed to ensure consistency and portability of Kubernetes across different environments. We want every developer to try Kubernetes on Azure, whether they are familiar with containers or not. We have two new announcements that make AKS easier than ever: Graphical user interfaces and wizard-based application onboarding help democratize Kubernetes and container technology for enterprise software developers, and we\u2019re thrilled to provide these new, simplified experiences for Build. Since we launched the AKS preview, we\u2019ve worked closely with customers to help shape the future of Kubernetes on Azure. We are listening to your feedback and feature requests, and we are happy to share some exciting enhancements to AKS in time for Build. We have many more features planned before we announce the GA of AKS in the next few weeks. Yet while we are passionate about delivering an enterprise-grade Kubernetes service, we also realize Kubernetes and container orchestration is still too tedious for many developers. Imagine you are a new employee trying to fix a bug on a complex microservices application consisting of dozens of components, each with their own configuration and backing services. To get started, you must configure your local development environment so that it can mimic production. Setup your IDE, build tool chain, containerized service dependencies, a local Kubernetes environment, mocks for backing services, and more. With all the time involved setting up your development environment, fixing that first bug could take days. Or you could use Azure.\u00a0 With AKS and our new Dev Spaces capability, all a new developer needs is their IDE and the Azure CLI. The developer simply creates a new Dev Space inside AKS and they can begin working on any component of their microservice environment safely, without impeding production traffic flows. Thanks to innovative use of service mesh technology, a developer can work on any service in isolation by using a simple hostname prefix. Thanks to hot code swapping, developers can remote debug their application quickly, as code is intelligently synchronized from the IDE into live containers running inside AKS. Dev Spaces for AKS, now in private preview, makes developing against a complex microservices environment simple. We are thrilled to see the customers so passionate about using Kubernetes on Azure. At KubeCon last week, we showcased open source developer tooling like Helm, Draft, and Brigade which empower developers working on any Kubernetes environment. Now at \/\/Build we are showcasing enhanced versions these open source technologies \u2013 graphical interfaces, integrated monitoring, enterprise networking, and best-of-breed developer tooling \u2013 making Azure the best Kubernetes experience in the cloud.

Workers with cash to spare may be tempted to front-load their 401(k) retirement account contributions, maxing out their tax-advantaged contributions before the year's end. (For 2016, the IRS limit for tax-advantaged 401(k) contributions is $18,000, and $24,000 for those 50 or older.) This may result in more of your pay making it to your checking account for the year's remaining pay periods, which could come in handy around vacation time or the holidays. But if your employer offers matching contributions, beware: maxing out your 401(k) early could mean you lose out on a portion of your employer's match. Here's how it could happen, in a nutshell: Suppose your employer's 401(k) program provides a certain percentage match to each employee contribution per pay period. If you max out your 401(k) contributions early in the year and subsequently stop making contributions, your employer will also stop making matches, assuming the employer's plan does not provide for \"true up\" contributions. (More on true ups later.) Let\u2019s assume that an employer will match 50 percent of an employee\u2019s contribution per pay period, up to 6 percent of employee compensation. A worker earning $75,000 would be paid $3,125 twice a month. To contribute enough money to reach the IRS's $18,000 contribution limit, she would need to contribute $750 per pay period, or 24 percent of her salary. In that scenario, the employer would contribute $93.75 in matching funds per pay period, since 6 percent of the employee\u2019s pay would be $187.50, and $93.75 is half of that. If, however, the worker decided to contribute $818.18 per pay period instead, she would max out her 401(k) contributions before the end of the year\u2014by the 22nd pay period of the year, to be exact. For the two remaining pay periods of the year, her contribution would be $0\u2014 and her employer's matching contribution would be $0 as well because there would be nothing to match. That would mean she missed out on an extra $187.50 in contributions. \"Whether she had decided to contribute $750 or the $818.18 per pay period, she would have ended up contributing the same $18,000 total during the year to the retirement plan,\" said Anne St. Martin, a manager at the Society for Human Resource Management's Knowledge Center. \"But if she had contributed $818.18 per pay period, she would have missed out on getting the employer match for each of the last two pay periods of the year.\" That $187.50 in matching funds might not seem like much, but it can add up over the years\u2014particularly when you factor in the returns you are missing on that money. And the consequences of 401(k) front-loading could be larger for high earners who max out just months into a new year or employees who decide to max out their contribution with a bonus awarded in the first months of the year, precluding them from several months' of employer matches. You might be in luck, however, because some 401(k) plans include a feature that allows workers to get the maximum employer match even if they've finished contributing to their 401(k) plans early in the year. The feature, called a true up, allows employees to receive employer matches that they would have otherwise missed out on because of 401(k) front-loading or because they spread their 401(k) contributions out unevenly throughout the year. In the example used above, had the worker's 401(k) plan included a true up feature, she would have received $187.50 in employer matching funds at the end of the year in addition to the matching funds she received during the pay periods when she did contribute to her 401(k). Of nearly 400 companies surveyed, 45 percent offered 401(k) true ups, according to a 2015 report on defined contribution plans. Alternatively, your employer may calculate and make matching contributions on an annual basis. According to the 2015 survey, 12 percent of employers provide annual matching contributions. There is at least one case when front-loading 401(k) contributions may make sense, even when it means losing out on some employer matching funds: when you're planning on leaving your company, whether it's because you're joining a different employer or retiring. \"If you're leaving an employer, it may be very smart to frontload,\" said St. Martin. \"A new employer may have a waiting period for a new plan, or maybe you're retiring and you won't have a plan at all.\" Employees, she said, \"may like to front-load to take advantage of the pre-tax savings\" if they won't have access to 401(k) plans later in the year. When you're determining the size and schedule of your 401(k) contributions, consider checking with your company's human resources department to learn more about the structure of your 401(k) plan's employer matches. Here are a few questions to ask: Small differences in retirement savings habits can have a big impact over time, so it\u2019s important to always be on the lookout for ways to maximize the impact of your 401(k) contributions.","time":1525715661,"title":"Too Fast to Match?

The update, which only applies to apps in the Microsoft Store will increase the revenue share which is paid, further incentivizing developers to target the platform.    According to Microsoft, the revenue share will be upped to 95:5 in favor of the developer on all applications sold through the store on consumer Windows 10 devices - which includes Mobile, PC's, Windows Mixed Reality and the Surface Hub. This is a one-up on both Google and Apple, both of which offer revenue sharing of around 60:40 in favor of the developer. The company noted, however, that these new terms will not apply to games. Furthermore, it noted that if the application was purchased via a referral by the company - be it online advertising or similar methods - the share will drop to 85:15 in favor of the developer. The new fee structure will come into effect later this year through an update to the App Developer Agreement, which will outline its structure in further detail.

Given the multiplicity of vision systems and backups on board any given autonomous vehicle, it seemed impossible that any one of them failing could have prevented the car\u2019s systems from perceiving Elaine Herzberg, who was crossing the street directly in front of the lidar and front-facing cameras. Yet the car didn\u2019t even touch the brakes or sound an alarm. Combined with an inattentive safety driver, this failure resulted in Herzberg\u2019s death. Here\u2019s how Uber\u2019s self-driving cars are supposed to detect pedestrians  The only possibilities that made sense were: The sources cited by The Information say that Uber has determined B was the problem. Specifically, it was that the system was set up to ignore objects that it should have attended to; Herzberg seems to have been detected but considered a false positive. This is not good. Autonomous vehicles have superhuman senses: lidar that stretches out hundreds of feet in pitch darkness, object recognition that tracks dozens of cars and pedestrians at once, radar and other systems to watch the road around it unblinkingly. But all these senses are subordinate, like our own, to a \u201cbrain\u201d \u2014 a central processing unit that takes the information from the cameras and other sensors and combines it into a meaningful picture of the world around it, then makes decisions based on that picture in real time. This is by far the hardest part of the car to create, as Uber has shown. It doesn\u2019t matter how good your eyes are if your brain doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s looking at or how to respond properly. Update: Uber issued the following statement, but did not comment on the claims above: We\u2019re actively cooperating with the NTSB in their investigation. Out of respect for that process and the trust we\u2019ve built with NTSB, we can\u2019t comment on the specifics of the incident. In the meantime, we have initiated a top-to-bottom safety review of our self-driving vehicles program, and we have brought on former NTSB Chair Christopher Hart to advise us on our overall safety culture. Our review is looking at everything from the safety of our system to our training processes for vehicle operators, and we hope to have more to say soon. As this is a situation without precedent, the NTSB and other reports may be particularly difficult to create and slow to issue, and it\u2019s not abnormal for a company or individual to hold off from revealing too much information ahead of publication.","time":1525715563,"title":"Uber vehicle reportedly saw but ignored woman it struck","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/07\/uber-vehicle-reportedly-saw-but-ignored-woman-it-struck\/","label":5,"label_name":"ml"},{"by":"banderon","descendants":153,"id":17013985,"kids":"[17014783, 17014622, 17017610, 17016763, 17016390, 17017594, 17017177, 17017737, 17017389, 17016989, 17018898, 17015812, 17016830, 17016950, 17015583]","score":183,"text":"Kubernetes, the open source container orchestration tool, came out of Google several years ago and has gained traction amazingly fast. With each step in its growth, it has created opportunities for companies to develop businesses on top of the open source project. The beauty of open source is that when it works, you build a base platform and an economic ecosystem follows in its wake. That\u2019s because a project like Kubernetes (or any successful open source offering) generates new requirements as a natural extension of the growth and development of a project. Those requirements represent opportunities for new projects, of course, but also for startups looking at building companies adjacent that open source community. Before that can happen however, a couple of key pieces have to fall into place. For starters you need the big corporates to get behind it. In the case of Kuberentes, in a 6 week period last year in quick succession between July and the beginning of September, we saw some of the best known enterprise technology companies including\u00a0AWS,\u00a0Oracle,\u00a0Microsoft,\u00a0VMware and Pivotal\u00a0all join the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), the professional organization behind the open source project. This was a signal that Kubernetes was becoming a standard of sorts for container orchestration. Surely these big companies would have preferred (and tried) to control the orchestration layer themselves, but they soon found that their customers preferred to use Kubernetes  and they had little choice, but to follow the clear trend that was developing around the project. Photo:\u00a0Georgijevic on Getty Images The second piece that has to come together for an open source community to flourish is that a significant group of developers have to accept it and start building stuff on top of the platform \u2014 and Kubernetes got that too. Consider that according to CNCF, a\u00a0total of 400 projects have been developed on the platform by 771 developers contributing over 19,000 commits since the launch of Kubernetes 1.0 in 2015. Since last August, the last date for which the CNCF has numbers, developer contributions had increased by 385 percent. That\u2019s a ton of momentum. When you have those two ingredients in place \u2014 developers and large vendors \u2014 you can begin to gain velocity. As more companies and more developers come, the community continues to grow, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been seeing with Kubernetes. As that happens, it typically doesn\u2019t take long for investors to take notice, and according to CNCF, there has been over $4 billion in investments so far in cloud native companies \u2014 this from a project that didn\u2019t even exist that long ago. Photo: Fitria Ramli \/ EyeEm on Getty Images. That investment has taken the form of venture capital funding startups trying to build something on top of Kubernetes, and we\u2019ve seen some big raises. Earlier this month, Hasura raised a $1.6M seed round for a packaged version Kubernetes designed specially to meet the needs of developers. Just last week, Upbound, a new startup from Seattle got $9 million in its Series A round to help manage multi-cluster and multi-cloud environments in a standard (cloud-native) way. A little further up the maturity curve, Heptio has raised over $33 million with its most recent round being a $25 million Series B\u00a0last September. Finally, there is CoreOS, which raised almost $50 million before being sold to Red Hat for $250 million in January. CoreOS wasn\u2019t alone by any means as we\u2019ve seen other exits coming over the last year or two with organizations scooping up cloud native startups. In particular, when you see the largest organizations like Microsoft, Oracle and Red Hat buying relatively young startups, they are often looking for talent, customers and products to get up to speed more quickly in a growing technology area like Kubernetes.  Kubernetes has grown and developed into an economic powerhouse in short period of time as dozens of side projects have developed around it, creating even more opportunity for companies of all sizes to build products and services to meet an ever-growing set of needs in a virtuous cycle of investment, innovation and economic activity. Cloud Native Computing Foundation projects.

All rights reserved. Today we are launching the 2018 edition of Cutting Edge Deep Learning for Coders, part 2 of fast.ai\u2019s free deep learning course. Just as with our part 1 Practical Deep Learning for Coders, there are no pre-requisites beyond high school math and 1 year of coding experience\u2014we teach you everything else you need along the way. This course contains all new material, including new state of the art results in NLP classification (up to 20% better than previously known approaches), and shows how to replicate recent record-breaking performance results on Imagenet and CIFAR10. The main libraries used are PyTorch and fastai (we explain why we use PyTorch and why we created the fastai library in this article). Each of the seven lessons includes a video that\u2019s around two hours long, an interactive Jupyter notebook, and a dedicated discussion thread on the fast.ai forums. The lessons cover many topics, including: multi-object detection with SSD and YOLOv3; how to read academic papers; customizing a pre-trained model with a custom head; more complex data augmentation (for coordinate variables, per-pixel classification, etc); NLP transfer learning; handling very large (billion+ token) text corpuses with the new fastai.text library; running and intepreting ablation studies; state of the art NLP classification; multi-modal learning; multi-task learning; bidirectional LSTM with attention for seq2seq; neural translation; customizing resnet architectures; GANs, WGAN, and CycleGAN; data ethics; super resolution; image segmentation with u-net. Lesson 8 starts with a quick recap of what we learned in part 1, and introduces the new focus of this part of the course: cutting edge research. We talk about how to read papers, and what you\u2019ll need to build your own deep learning box to run your experiments. Even if you\u2019ve never read an academic paper before, we\u2019ll show you how to do so in a way that you don\u2019t get overwhelmed by the notation and writing style. Another difference in this part is that we\u2019ll be digging deeply into the source code of the fastai and Pytorch libraries: in this lesson we\u2019ll show you how to quickly navigate and build an understanding of the code. And we\u2019ll see how to use python\u2019s debugger to deepen your understand of what\u2019s going on, as well as to fix bugs. The main topic of this lesson is object detection, which means getting a model to draw a box around every key object in an image, and label each one correctly. You may be surprised to discover that we can use transfer learning from an Imagenet classifier that was never even trained to do detection! There are two main tasks: find and localize the objects, and classify them; we\u2019ll use a single model to do both these at the same time. Such multi-task learning generally works better than creating different models for each task\u2014which many people find rather counter-intuitive. To create this custom network whilst leveraging a pre-trained model, we\u2019ll use fastai\u2019s flexible custom head architecture. In this lesson we\u2019ll move from single object to multi-object detection. It turns out that this slight difference makes things much more challenging. In fact, most students found this the most challenging lesson in the whole course. Not because any one piece is highly complex, but because there\u2019s a lot of pieces, so it really tests your understanding of the foundations we\u2019ve learnt so far. So don\u2019t worry if a lot of details are unclear on first viewing \u2013 come back to this lesson from time to time as you complete the rest of the course, and you should find more and more of it making sense! Our focus is on the single shot multibox detector (SSD), and the related YOLOv3 detector. These are ways to handle multi-object detection by using a loss function that can combine losses from multiple objects, across both localization and classification. They also use a custom architecture that takes advantage of the difference receptive fields of different layers of a CNN. And we\u2019ll see how to handle data augmentation in situations like this one where the dependent variable requires augmentation too. Finally, we discuss a simple but powerful trick called focal loss which is used to get state of the art results in this field. After reviewing what we\u2019ve learned about object detection, in lesson 10 we jump into NLP, starting with an introduction to the new fastai.text library. This is a replacement for torchtext which is faster and more flexible in many situations. A lot of this class will be very familiar\u2014we\u2019re covering a lot of the same ground as lesson 4. But this lesson will show you how to get much more accurate results, by using transfer learning for NLP. Transfer learning has revolutionized computer vision, but until now it largely has failed to make much of an impact in NLP (and to some extent has been simply ignored). In this class we\u2019ll show how pre-training a full language model can greatly surpass previous approaches based on simple word vectors. We\u2019ll use this language model to show a new state of the art result in text classification. In lesson 11 we\u2019re going to learn to translate French into English! To do so, we\u2019ll learn how to add attention to an LSTM in order to build a sequence to sequence (seq2seq) model. But before we do, we\u2019ll do a review of some key RNN foundations, since a solid understanding of those will be critical to understanding the rest of this lesson. A seq2seq model is one where both the input and the output are sequences, and can be of difference lengths. Translation is a good example of a seq2seq task. Because each translated word can correspond to one or more words that could be anywhere in the source sentence, we learn an attention mechanism to figure out which words to focus on at each time step. We\u2019ll also learn about some other tricks to improve seq2seq results, including teacher forcing and bidirectional models. We finish the lesson by discussing the amazing DeVISE paper, which shows how we can bridge the divide between text and images, using them both in the same model! We start this lesson with a deep dive into the DarkNet architecture used in YOLOv3, and use it to better understand all the details and choices that you can make when implementing a resnet-ish architecture. The basic approach discussed here is what we used to win the DAWNBench competition! Then we\u2019ll learn about Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This is, at its heart, a different kind of loss function. GANs have a generator and a discriminator that battle it out, and in the process combine to create a generative model that can create highly realistic outputs. We\u2019ll be looking at the Wasserstein GAN variant, since it\u2019s easier to train and more resilient to a range of hyperparameters. For the start of lesson 13 we\u2019ll cover the CycleGAN, which is a breakthrough idea in GANs that allows us to generate images even where we don\u2019t have direct (paired) training data. We\u2019ll use it to turn horses into zebras, and visa versa; this may not be an application you need right now\u2026 but the basic idea is likely to be transferable to a wide range of very valuable applications. One of our students is already using it to create a new form of visual art. But generative models (and many other techniques we\u2019ve discussed) can cause harm just as easily as they can benefit society. So we spend some time talking about data ethics. It\u2019s a topic that really deserves its own whole course; whilst we can\u2019t go into the detail we\u2019d like in the time available, hopefully you\u2019ll get a taste of some of the key issues, and ideas for where to learn more. We finish the lesson by looking at style transfer, an interesting approach that allows us to change the style of images in whatever way we like. The approach requires us to optimize pixels, instead of weights, which is an interesting different way of looking at optimization. In this final lesson, we do a deep dive into super resolution, an amazing technique that allows us to restore high resolution detail in our images, based on a convolutional neural network. In the process, we\u2019ll look at a few modern techniques for faster and more reliable training of generative convnets. We close with a look at image segmentation, in particular using the Unet architecture, a state of the art technique that has won many Kaggle competitions and is widely used in industry. Image segmentation models allow us to precisely classify every part of an image, right down to pixel level.","time":1525709536,"title":"Cutting Edge Deep Learning for Coders: 2018 Edition","type":"story","url":"http:\/\/www.fast.ai\/2018\/05\/07\/part2-launch\/","label":5,"label_name":"ml"},{"by":"dankohn1","descendants":3,"id":17013855,"kids":"[17014004, 17014731, 17014605]","score":47,"text":"Above: Google's Kelsey Hightower speaks at KubeCon. The four years that William Morgan spent as an engineer at Twitter battling the Fail Whale gave him a painful view into what happens when a company\u2019s rickety web infrastructure gets spread too thin. But while Twitter\u2019s instability was highly publicized, Morgan realized that the phenomenon existed to some degree across the web, as companies were building applications in ways that were never intended to handle such scale. The result: Applications and software were becoming too expensive, too hard to manage, and too slow to deploy, and they required too many developers and caused too much downtime. After leaving Twitter in 2014, Morgan wanted to use some of the lessons he had learned to help other companies reimagine the way they build applications for the web. That led to the founding in 2015 of Buoyant, whose application development tools have become part of an insurgent movement to fundamentally transform the way software and services are designed for the web. Referring to what is in some cases dubbed\u00a0\u201cmicroservices\u201d or \u201ccloud native computing,\u201d the development philosophy holds that breaking applications into smaller, self-contained units can significantly reduce costs and time needed to write, deploy, and manage each one. The result should be a web that is faster yet more stable. And just as compelling to proponents, it should deliver a more open web that makes it easier for users to change cloud platforms. While such shifts in development philosophy typically take many years, cloud native computing has caught fire and is having a big moment. Even though it remains small overall, the uptake and enthusiasm has even taken advocates like Morgan by surprise. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of incredible how rapidly this has been growing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt speaks to the fact that people are focused on the right thing, which is solving actual problems. What we are seeing here is just a beginning. But I think this could fundamentally change everything about web development.\u201d That optimism was on display this week at the latest edition of a conference called KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2018 in Copenhagen, Denmark. The event drew Morgan, along with 4,300 other attendees from around the world. While conferences are never a perfect barometer of an industry, that figure is up from the 500 people who attended the first such gathering in November 2015. The event is organized by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, an open source organization that operates under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation. CNCF was created just over three years ago to shepherd this new movement.\nThe current momentum around cloud native computing seems to be a function of both the right solution and the right timing. As web development has evolved, there has been a tendency to develop \u201cmonolithic\u201d applications \u2014 that is, software that contains most or all parts of the code for a given company or service. Over time, those code bases have grown to massive sizes and become hugely complex, which has led to a wide array of problems. Developing and maintaining such applications can take an enormous number of developers. Even for companies that have made the necessary investments and hired those developers, making any changes or updates can be cumbersome and take weeks. For others, the resources needed to build the technology can seem like an insurmountable challenge. \u201cSoftware has gotten a lot more complex,\u201d said Ben Sigelman, cofounder and CEO of LightStep, a San Francisco-based startup that makes performance management tools for microservices. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten a lot more powerful, but it crossed a threshold where the complexity of the code to deliver those features requires hundreds and hundreds of developers. And once you have hundreds of developers working on the code, you\u2019re in a dangerous place. It\u2019s an efficiency issue, and it can lead to paralysis.\u201d The solution, according to adherents of cloud native computing, is to break these big slabs of code into self-contained functions or features. This modular approach, particularly if it\u2019s based on open sources tools, would ideally make constructing web services and maintaining them far more efficient. Each piece could be deployed or updated rapidly, by fewer developers, without having to worry that it\u2019s going to blow up the entire code base. This concept of microservices has been floating around for some time. But it got a big boost in 2013 when San Francisco-based Docker released its first product. Docker helped popularize the use of \u201ccontainers,\u201d a technology that places all the necessary pieces for an application to run in one package. That allows the application to be moved across different platforms and operating systems without having to be rewritten. The following year, Google announced a project some of its engineers had been developing to enable the deployment and management of containerized applications called Kubernetes. While Google felt that Kubernetes could provide a powerful boost to cloud-based services, it also recognized that its acceptance would be limited as long as it was seen as a Google project, according to Kelsey Hightower, Google\u2019s Kubernetes community member and co-chair of the KubeCon conference. So Google approached the Linux Foundation about open-sourcing Kubernetes. Those talks led to the creation of CNCF, which also counted Twitter, Huawei, Intel, Cisco, IBM, Docker, Univa, and VMware among its founding members. Rather than being just a Kubernetes project, the foundation decided to take a wider view, positioning itself as a body that would oversee and encourage development of all the pieces needed to build applications using this new model. CNCF says it now has 20 projects \u2014 including Kubernetes \u2014 in some stage of development. Just as critically, CNCF now counts every major cloud service provider as a member. Over the past 12 months, Dan Kohn, executive director of CNCF, said he has been surprised by how quickly industry partners, many of them cloud platform rivals, have bought into the movement and joined the foundation. Microsoft announced it was joining last July. Amazon Web Services joined last August and hosted a networking event for developers at KubeCon. While Docker was already a founding member, it announced it was going to become more deeply involved by donating another of its tools, Containerd, to CNCF last year and doing more to support Kubernetes. \u201cThe aspiration was always to get everyone around the table,\u201d said Kohn. \u201cFrankly, I didn\u2019t expect it to happen so quickly.\u201d Above: Dan Kohn, executive director of Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It wasn\u2019t necessarily an easy decision for the companies. The fight to win in the public cloud space is a fierce one. Tools like Kubernetes and microservices eliminate some competitive advantages because they allow for easier data portability. For companies just moving into the cloud-based world, the ability to avoid the risk of vendor lock-in is another appeal of cloud native computing. \u201cEveryone is so conscious of software coming from one source,\u201d said Gareth Rushgrove, a Docker product manager. \u201cThey are worried they might not be able to get out from under one vendor solution. That\u2019s one of the reasons CNCF and this community have been so useful.\u201d So what was the catalyst? Most likely these companies saw the reality of where the market was heading as use of Kubernetes continued growing quickly. More companies are under pressure to digitize, and they increasingly see cloud native computing as a faster and easier way to get there. \u201cThe users are what is really driving this,\u201d said Abby Kearn, executive director of open source organization\u00a0Cloud Foundry, a CNCF sister group under the Linux Foundation umbrella. \u201cThey need to digitally transform and become technology companies. If you\u2019re a bank, and you\u2019re not transforming and trying to become a technology company, where does that leave you? You\u2019ve got a ton of fintech companies coming for your customers.\u201d At the three-day conference, organizers announced that Chinese internet giant JD.com had 20,000 servers running Kubernetes, making it one of the largest adopters in the world. A report commissioned by LightStep, which surveyed 353 developers from companies around the world, found that 86 percent expect microservices will become the default development architecture within five years. And the three-day KubeCon was packed with participating companies making announcements designed to expand the ecosystem of related products and services. Jason McGee, vice president and CTO of IBM Cloud Platform, said his company is betting big on cloud native solutions because they have the potential to help its customers move faster. Microservices are allowing companies to mix and match containerized, open source solutions so they don\u2019t have to build everything from scratch. \u201cI can build a microservice that you can re-use,\u201d McGee said. \u201cThat will allow the overall industry to go faster. Right now, we spend a lot of time re-solving the same problems.\u201d Naturally, this frenzy has sparked interest from venture capitalists. Buoyant has raised $14 million. And LightStep has raised $27 million over two rounds after Sigelman initially told potential Series A investors to hold off because he wasn\u2019t sure how quickly users might embrace microservices. \u201cI knew that the idea made sense,\u201d said Sigelman, who worked at Google for nine years before striking out on his own. \u201cI didn\u2019t know about the timing. I told Series A investors to wait for it. I knew it was going to happen. I didn\u2019t know when.\u201d For all this optimism, there are still plenty of skeptics who see cloud native computing and microservices as an overhyped development fad. Even CNCF members openly acknowledge that many challenges lie ahead. Speaking on stage to open the conference, Kohn posed the question \u201cIs our software good enough?\u201d and then answered it by declaring, \u201cNo.\u201d Part of the issue is that while there are many potential benefits to making the transition to microservices, older tools for things like communicating between applications and monitoring app performance won\u2019t work in this environment. That same LightStep survey found that 99 percent of developers surveyed reported some \u201cchallenges\u201d in using microservices, with more than half saying it was increasing their operational challenges. This begs the question: Is the move to microservices simply trading an old set of problems for new ones? Put another way, will the promised benefits significantly outweigh the headaches? Sigelman says the answer is yes, noting that the new architecture can potentially reduce the risk of a single failure bringing down someone\u2019s entire system. \u201cThe operational efficiencies will be there regardless,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get rid of some really profound problems.\u201d Of course, that\u2019s also an opportunity for people like Sigelman, whose company is making tools to solve some of those new issues. And indeed, that was true of many of the startups on hand, as many of the product announcements were aimed at plugging those gaps and bolstering the overall maturity of this approach. Still, conference organizers sought to infuse the gathering with a greater sense of urgency right from the start. Hightower of Google kicked off the conference by issuing a challenge to the audience.

They established a republic in the place of the monarchy, and sought to make the government accountable to the people. In the years since, the people of most of the Earth\u2019s nations have followed suit and rid their nations of monarchical governments. Among the absolute monarchies still in power, the most egregious is that of the Saud family of Saudi Arabia. We are appalled that the MIT administration agreed to meet and presumably negotiated programs with the Saudi Crown Prince, Mohamed Bin Salman (MBS). This was done without any consultation with faculty or student organizations.  Saudi Arabia, in fact, remains an oppressive absolute monarchy, and the source of great human suffering, most notably from their war on the people of Yemen. Bin Salman was on a U.S. tour, and earlier met with President Trump, who had approved the sale of $billions worth of U.S. missiles and warplanes to the Saudi government. The weapons are among those used in the Saudi-led war on Yemen that has left thousands of civilians dead since 2015. The United States is also assisting the Saudi monarchy in the coalition\u2019s targeting selection for aerial bombings and actively providing midair refueling for Saudi and United Arab Emirates jets that conduct indiscriminate airstrikes \u2013 the leading cause of civilian casualties. Meanwhile, the Saudi coalition is starving millions of Yemenis as a grotesque tactic of war. According to the UN, the blockade of Yemeni ports by the Saudi military has resulted in \u201cthe largest famine the world has seen in decades,\u201d causing a massive cholera epidemic and leaving 400,000 children malnourished. Bin Salman\u2019s extensive public relations campaign directed at Americans has painted him as a \u201creformer\u201d who is supporting, for example, the rights of women to drive, while ignoring the continuing general oppression of women in Saudi Arabia, imprisoning hundreds without trial, and actively opposing democratic movements in other Arab states.  Cambridge City Councilor and MIT alumnus Quinton Zondervan, speaking at the demonstration against Bin Salman\u2019s visit, stated clearly \u201cWe do not need to show respect to an oppressor and a bully and a warmonger.\u201d U.S. Congressmen Rho Khanna, Marc Pocan, and Walter Jones (New York Times, October 10, 2017) have criticized our government for \u201cparticipating in a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in a brutal military campaign in Yemen.\u201d  On April 2 the Cambridge City Council went on record in opposition to the oppressive policies of MBS and Saudi Arabia,\u00a0stated its disappointment at the manner in which the visit was hidden by Harvard and MIT, and requested that copies of the resolution be delivered to the Presidents of both MIT and Harvard as well as MBS. The Tech reported on the meeting in their April 5 issue, and published a cogent and critical editorial. Due to the complete lack of candor of the MIT administration, we don\u2019t know the precise nature of the business between the Crown Prince and MIT. According to Grif Peterson and Yarden Katz, of Harvard\u2019s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, writing in the Guardian (Friday, March 30, 2018) \u201c. . . Bin Salman\u2019s foundation, MiSK, was accepted as a \u2018member company\u2019 to MIT\u2019s Media Lab in 2017, which requires a minimum annual contribution of $250,000 (with a three-year commitment) to the lab. In return, MiSK receives access to the lab\u2019s personnel, technology, and intellectual property.\u201d Regardless of the content, MIT should not be entering into an agreement with representatives of the Saudi regime. This recalls the Shah of Irans\u2019s effort to secure nuclear engineering graduate slots for the Shah\u2019s chosen candidates. This was eventually rejected due to opposition from the faculty. At a minimum, President Reif should have reported to the faculty on the visit of Bin Salman. He now needs to ensure that MIT has not entered into any further agreements with the Saudi government or Royal Family that ignore their record of oppression, discrimination, and human rights violations.     \n     Editorial Subcommittee Manduhai Buyandelger\nChristopher Cummins\nJonathan King \nRuth Perry\nNasser Rabbat \n","time":1525709033,"title":"MIT Should Not Be Supporting the Saud Monarchy","type":"story","url":"http:\/\/web.mit.edu\/fnl\/volume\/304\/editorial.html","label":7,"label_name":"random"},{"by":"leahculver","descendants":2,"id":17013799,"kids":"[17014990]","score":68,"text":" Over 600,000 repositories received statuses in January 2018 alone\u2014more than a 50 percent increase from last year\u2014and now statuses will provide you with more information than ever.

The Checks API allows you to build sophisticated tools for continuous integration (CI), linting, and acceptance testing on GitHub. This new functionality currently works with the GitHub REST API, with GraphQL support coming soon. Instead of pass\/fail build statuses, your integrations can now report richer results, annotate code with detailed information, and kick off reruns\u2014all within the GitHub user interface.  Build outputs are now accessible with the new \u201cChecks\u201d tab on pull requests. Inline annotations are simple to find, too. They\u2019ll appear right alongside the relevant code in the pull request, so you can identify and address failing checks even faster. Learn more about the Checks API Over the last several weeks, we\u2019ve worked closely with partners on fine-tuning the Checks experience\u2014and we\u2019re excited to share several apps already using the API. Microsoft maintains hundreds of open source projects on GitHub, including Visual Studio Code, which had the most community participants among any project last year, and TypeScript, one of the fastest growing languages in 2017. Now we\u2019re partnering with Microsoft to integrate Azure\u2019s DevOps services with GitHub, starting with Azure\u2019s Mobile CI service. GitHub will detect mobile projects and suggest developers set up mobile CI using any one of our providers, including App Center. With App Center installed, you can automate builds on every commit, test apps on real devices in the cloud, and monitor usage with crash and analytics data. And because the App Center integration uses the Checks API, mobile developers will be able to see the results directly within GitHub\u2019s interface.  To provide you with simple, streamlined experiences for tools you already use, we\u2019re also integrating GitHub with Microsoft Outlook using Adaptive Cards. Over the next several weeks, Outlook users will be able to comment on issues from their inbox\u2014and soon after, be able to merge pull requests, too.  As a leading provider of hosted CI, Travis CI has been helping build and test open source and private projects for more than seven years. Travis CI recently adopted GitHub Apps and now includes Checks as a way for your team to share the results of your project\u2019s branch and pull request builds.

In that early case, officers convinced thousands of men to voluntarily turn over blood samples, building a genetic dragnet to search for a killer in their midst. The murderer was eventually identified by his attempts to avoid giving up his DNA. In contrast, suspected Golden State Killer Joseph James DeAngelo, who was apprehended just last week, was found through other people\u2019s DNA \u2014 samples taken from the crime scenes were matched to the profiles his distant relatives had uploaded to a publicly accessible genealogy website. You can see the rise of a modern privacy conundrum in the 32 years between the first DNA case and DeAngelo\u2019s arrest. Digital privacy experts say that the way DeAngelo was found has implications reaching far beyond genetics, and the risks of exposure apply to everyone \u2014 not just alleged serial killers. We\u2019re used to thinking about privacy breaches as what happens when we give data about ourselves to a third party, and that data is then stolen from or abused by that third party. It\u2019s bad, sure. But we could have prevented it if we\u2019d only made better choices. Increasingly, though, individuals need to worry about another kind of privacy violation. I think of it as a modern tweak on the tragedy of the commons \u2014 call it \u201cprivacy of the commons.\u201d It\u2019s what happens when one person\u2019s voluntary disclosure of personal information exposes the personal information of others who had no say in the matter. Your choices didn\u2019t cause the breach. Your choices can\u2019t prevent it, either. Welcome to a world where you can\u2019t opt out of sharing, even if you didn\u2019t opt in. Yonatan Zunger, a former Google privacy engineer, noted we\u2019ve known for a long time that one person\u2019s personal information is never just their own to share. It\u2019s the idea behind the old proverb, \u201cThree may keep a secret if two of them are dead.\u201d And as far back as the 1960s, said Jennifer Lynch, senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, phone companies could help law enforcement collect a list of all the numbers one phone line called and how long the calls lasted. The phone records may help convict a guilty party, but they also likely call police attention to the phone numbers, identities and habits of people who may not have anything to do with the crime being investigated. But the digital economy has changed things, making the privacy of the commons easier to exploit and creating stronger incentives to do so. \u201cOne of the fascinating things we\u2019ve now walked ourselves into is that companies are valued by the market on the basis of how much user data they have,\u201d said Daniel Kahn Gillmor, senior staff technologist with the ACLU\u2019s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. A company can run along, not making a cent, but if it has a large user base and reams of private information about those users, then it\u2019s valuable \u2014 and can be sold for millions. Companies that collect more data, keep that data, and use it to make connections between users are worth more. Sears, Roebuck and Co. may have been able to infer when you bought a gift from their catalog for a friend who lived in another town, but Amazon has more reason (and more ability) to use that information to build a profile of your friend\u2019s interests. We all saw this in action in the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal. The privacy of the commons is how the 270,000 Facebook users who actually downloaded the \u201cthisisyourdigitallife\u201d app turned into as many as 87 million users whose data ended up in the hands of a political marketing firm. Much of the narrative surrounding that scandal has focused on what individuals should be doing to protect themselves. But that idea that privacy is all about your individual decisions is part of the problem, said Julie Cohen, a technology and law professor at Georgetown University. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of burden being put on individuals to have an understanding and mastery of something that\u2019s so complex that it would be impossible for them to do what they need to do,\u201d she said. Even if you do your searches from a specialized browser, tape over all your webcams and monitor your privacy settings without fail, your personal data has probably still been collected, stored and used in ways you didn\u2019t intend \u2014 and don\u2019t even know about. Companies can even build a profile of a person from birth based entirely on data-sharing choices made by others, said Salome Viljoen, a lawyer and fellow with the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard. Imagine new parents signing up for a loyalty card at their local pharmacy and then filling all of their child\u2019s prescriptions there. The information collected every time they scan that loyalty card adds up to something like a medical history, which could later be sold to data brokers or combined with data bought from brokers to paint a fuller picture of a person who never consented to any of this. So does that mean that, in addition to locking down our own privacy choices, we need to police the choices of our friends and family? No, said Cohen, Gillmor and Viljoen. In fact, the privacy of the commons means that, in some cases, your data is collected in ways you cannot reasonably prevent, no matter how carefully you or anyone you know behaves. Take, for instance, Equifax, the credit-rating company that lost control of the data of 143 million people last year. Those people weren\u2019t necessarily members of Equifax. Instead, the company collected data from other companies the people chose to do business with, and much of that business was stuff people can\u2019t get by without, like renting or owning a home. Or, alternately, consider Facebook, again. That company has admitted it tracks the online behavior of people who never intentionally engage with it at all, thanks to partnerships with other websites. (Like many sites, FiveThirtyEight has this kind of partnership with Facebook. Our pages talk to the social network in several ways, including through ads and comments, and because of the embedded \u201cLike\u201d button.) If hounding every person you\u2019ve ever cared about into adopting encryption tools like PGP sounded like fun, you\u2019ll love living in a van down by the river with no internet access.1 Instead, experts say these examples show that we need to think about online privacy less as a personal issue and more as a systemic one. Our digital commons is set up to encourage companies and governments to violate your privacy. If you live in a swamp and an alligator attacks you, do you blame yourself for being a slow swimmer? Or do you blame the swamp for forcing you to hang out with alligators? There isn\u2019t yet a clear answer for what the U.S. should do. Almost all of our privacy law and policy is framed around the idea of privacy as a personal choice, Cohen said. The result: very little regulation addressing what data can be collected, how it should be protected, or what can be done with it. In some ways, Gillmor said, online privacy is where the environmental movement was back in the 1950s, when lots of big, centralized choices were hurting individuals\u2019 health, and individuals had little power to change that. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if we have had our \u2018Silent Spring\u2019 yet,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe Cambridge Analytica will be our \u2018Silent Spring.\u2019\u201d And I hope you\u2019re prepared to buy the van with cash, because if you need credit, the credit check the dealer runs could hand your information to Equifax again.

Unfortunately political pressure intervened and the will to proceed with it simply evaporated. \u00a0 The new engine (the Olympus 610 +25%) had, as its name suggests, more thrust and eliminated noisy, fuel-guzzling afterburners. \u00a0 The wing was redesigned, had leading edge \u2018droop\u2019 and carried more fuel. With better lift\/drag, specific fuel consumption and more fuel the range of the Concorde Model \u2018B\u2019 increased over the original Concorde \u2018A\u2019 Model. Just four months after Concorde began her scheduled services in 1976, a Concorde \u2018B\u2019 model was first discussed and designed with slightly larger fuel capacity and slightly larger wings with leading edge slats to improve aerodynamic performance at all speeds. It featured more powerful engines with sound deadening and without the fuel-hungry and noisy reheat. It was speculated that it was reasonably possible to create an engine with up to 25% gain in efficiency over the Rolls-Royce\/Snecma Olympus 593.This would have given 500\u00a0mi (805 km) additional range even with greater payload, and would have made new commercial routes possible. This was cancelled due in part to poor sales of Concorde, but also to the rising cost of aviation fuel in the 1970s. \u00a0 During 1976 Jacques Mitterrand, the Chairman and Managing Director of Aerospatiale, submitted a proposal to investigate an improved version of Concorde \u2013 the \u201cVersion B\u201d to Mr. Cavaille, French Secretary of State to Transport a similar letter was submitted to the British government at that time. \u00a0 The letter that he sent elaborated on the quality of the work which had been carried out and the know-how that had now been acquired by the four French and British engineering companies (Aerospatiale, BAe, Rolls Royce and SNECMA). In this letter he also stressed the importance of the role that the manufacturers of Concorde could have in the development of a second-generation supersonic aircraft, that would be foreseeable during the 1990\u2019s, could lead to probably in some form of a collaboration between Europe and the United States. \u00a0 An exploratory study was actually already underway during this time, looking into upgrading the capabilities of the current Concorde design for the early 1980\u2019s. The letter submitted also gave the official go ahead for this exploratory study and proposed a full feasibility study for a Concorde \u2018B\u2019 design. \u00a0 Due to the manufactures having great difficulty selling the remaining five Concorde airframes that were built during the initial production run, Concorde 216 (G-BOAF) was to be the last Concorde \u2018A\u2019 built, and 217 was planned to be a Concorde \u2018B\u2019 version. Had Concorde \u2018B\u2019 been built, what type of future would we be living in now? If the additional range and performance had been available then many more airlines might have purchased Concorde and passenger air travel as we know it today might have been completely different. \u00a0 She was planned to have a range approaching and even exceeding 5000 miles. But it is easy to imagine the potential range of Concorde \u2018B\u2019 design, when you consider that the Concorde \u201cA\u201d model used by British Airways had a design specification range of 3690 miles, had to regularly fly 4250 miles on a route between London Heathrow and Barbados. This was made possible due to operational improvements that pushed the range of Concorde \u2018A\u2019 to nearly 4500 miles. The improvements have included small changes to the aerodynamics of the original model\u2019s specifications. One interesting fact is that the take-off weight was made very low and close to the figures estimated for the Concorde \u2018B\u2019 design. \u00a0 The Concorde \u2018B\u2019 design would of also benefited from increased subsonic performance and reduced noise emissions. The cost of the Concorde Project was massive and with the poor sales of Concorde, and cancelled options from airlines, adding to that the rising cost of aviation fuel during the 1970s, the development of the Model \u2018B\u2019 version was considered too expensive and cancelled. Although the study carried out was a pretty comprehensive one and could of given Concorde a real future in during the years to come right into the 1990s and even on into the 2000s, after this time it was generally expected that a new generation SST with a new type of variable cycle engines would enter into service (BAe AST3 or Aerospatiale Alliance) \u00a0 The study into a Concorde \u2018B\u2019 design had two aims: \u00a0 1. To ensure the expansion and future demand for supersonic transport (SST), where the Anglo-French group was now and into the future as the main and only player, \u00a0 2. To maintain the high knowledge level gained by the manufacturers in Britain and France, and to provide a solid position for the participation in a future program of a second-generation SST. \u00a0 \u00a0 This feasibility study, was planned to last 9 months and was estimated to cost 9 million French francs, it was to comprise three areas: \u00a0 1. Engineering \u00a0 2. Development costs \u00a0 3. Markets \u00a0 If this exploratory and feasibility study was to confirmed an economic interest for the manufacturers, and then led to the decision of the launch of an improved version of Concorde, such an improved version (allowing for a 5 year development programme) could be ready by spring 1982 for the 17th production Concorde 217 \u00a0 Civil aviation history shows that almost all new aircraft constituted a base point for the start of improved versions (The Boeing 747-100 evolved into today\u2019s 747-400) and at this stage this was the plan for the Concorde program. \u00a0 The interest in this development process would have been beneficial to both the airlines and the manufacturers of Concorde: \u00a0 1. For the airlines, it would have offered performance improvements (lower direct operation costs, extension of the operating range, and reduction of environmental effects) while conserving the existing investments in crew training, maintenance procedures, etc. \u00a0 2. For the manufacturers, it would have made it possible to carry out these improvements at a minimum capital cost. Indeed the development of the initial production version generally revealed aerodynamic areas where gains could be made along with structural margins, but these could not be exploited due to the time constraints in getting Concorde into passenger service successfully. \u00a0 3. If the decision to build the B model would have been taken, the modifications would have been relatively inexpensive as they were just some minor changes to the existing production process, allowing the majority of the tooling to be maintained. The high level of knowledge that was gained during the certification of the current model would have greatly reduced time and costs during the certification of the B model. \u00a0 These considerations should have applied particularly to the case of Concorde, considering the exceptional degree of innovation obtained and the great amount of technical knowledge accumulated during the twelve years of development of the initial production version. \u00a0 The broad objectives of the Concorde \u2018B\u2019 version were to ensure the expansion of the network of routes that supersonic aircraft could use. \u00a0 The following improvements were considered to be necessary: \u00a0 Although the level of noise produced by Concorde at takeoff and landing is equivalent to that of the first generation long haul aircraft in service (B 707, DC8), only the second generation of long haul aircraft (B747, DC10, L1011) equipped with high-bypass jet engines satisfied the new international noise rules. With the reaction of the United States, which had at the start of scheduled Concorde services not accepted the use of Concorde on their territory, it would be important to reduce the level of noise generated by the aircraft. The operating range of the initial version \u2013 primarily designed for the connection Paris London-New York \u2013 was to be increased to allow connections of the type: \nOther European capital cities \u2013 East Coast of the US in one sector. \nUnited States \u2013 Japan in two sectors. \nEurope \u2013 Australia in three sectors. \u00a0 Concorde\u2019s fuel consumption accounts for a third of the direct operating cost (DOC). A reduction in fuel consumption would mean an improvement in economics for the airlines using the aircraft, making it even more marketable by the manufacturers, and also enable the airlines to reduce ticket prices. \u00a0 The objective of noise reduction implies an increase in the smoothness of flight during takeoff and landing, which also results in an improvement in all subsonic flight modes (climb, subsonic cruise, approach). \u00a0 This would also help in the above objective of increasing the operating range. \u00a0 This modification must respect two constraints: to preserve \u2013 if not improve \u2013 the supersonic smoothness of flight, and to limit the effects from modifications or additions on the central core structure of the wing, in order to re-use the majority of the tooling currently used in manufacture and assembly. A moderate increase in the range could be obtained by aerodynamic tweaks to the current design. These included lengthening the wing tips and mounting droop slats on the leading edges of the wings. These tweaks would reduce the induced drag at supersonic speeds and increase the available lift at slower speeds. \u00a0 The additional lift generated by the leading edge droops would permit the aircraft the fly at a lower angle of attack at slower speeds, therefore requiring less power to be generated by the powerplant, which in turn would reduce noise and increase fuel efficiency. \u00a0 \u00a0 Optimisation of twist and camber of the wing, combined with the increase in the lift coefficient (Cz) along with the increased thrust offered by the supersonic engine also allows improvements of the smoothness of flight at Mach 2. \u00a0 Detailed aerodynamic improvements, (reshaped trailing edge of the control surfaces and thinning of the lower lips of air intake) which were later applied to the current production models before they entered service, were also proposed to be continued on the Concorde\u00a0\u2019B\u2019 \u00a0 The majority of the noise produced by Concorde\u00a0during \u00a0takeoff and landing comes from the areas of strong aerodynamic shearing, which are\u00a0located at the edge of the exhaust system. \u00a0 The powerplant, which is optimised for supersonic cruise rather than subsonic flight would be modified so that gains could be made throughout the whole speed range during flight, and Specific gains could then be made in the fuel consumption in the transonic region, thus then giving an increase in the operating range required. Physically, the modifications would consist of replacing the low-pressure compressor with a compressor with a increased diameter, and the low pressure turbine assembly with a two-stage turbine. \u00a0 Then the installation of a discharge system to increase the margin of air flow through the engine would result in an increase in air flow which reaches 25 % on takeoff and 35 % during approach. The thrust gains obtained at takeoff and at transonic speeds could also make it possible to remove the reheat (afterburner) system with its very heavy fuel consumption and significant addition to the noise generated by the powerplant. \u00a0 The increase of capacity obtained by the enlarging of the external wing and the tank at the front of the wing could be supplemented by the addition of a fuselage tank connected to the latter. \u00a0 The maximum quantity of fuel that can be put on board increases from 95,254 kg to 99,790 kg. \u00a0 Changes would have been incorporated in the autopilot system for the takeoff and approach stages, in order to automatically optimise the aircraft in these key stages of flight and to reduce the noise levels around the airports during takeoff and landing. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The additional wing area along with the modifications to the engines and intakes would add to the empty weight of the aircraft: The reductions would have been obtained mainly by the use of carbon fibre in the construction of control surfaces, service doors, etc. \u00a0 The increase in the empty weight and the fuel carrying capability also requires an increase in the various performance characteristics (a payload of 24,800lbs\/11260kg is used).

Let\u2019s take a pair of two types <YourType, bool> - what can you do with such composition? In this article, I\u2019ll describe std:optional - a new helper type added in C++17. It\u2019s a wrapper for your type and a flag that indicates if the value is initialized or not. Let\u2019s see where it can be useful and how you can use it.  By adding the boolean flag to other types, you can achieve a thing called \u201cnullable types\u201d.  As mentioned, the flag is used to indicate whether the value is available or not. Such wrapper represents an object that might be empty in an expressive way (so not via comments :)) While you can achieve \u201cnull-ability\u201d by using unique values (-1, infinity, nullptr), it\u2019s not as clear as the separate wrapper type. Alternatively, you could even use std::unique_ptr<Type> and treat the empty pointer as not initialized - this works, but comes with the cost of allocating memory for the object.  Optional types - that come from functional programming world - bring type safety and expressiveness. Most of other languages have something similar: for example std::option in Rust, Optional<T> in Java, Data.Maybe in Haskell. std::optional was added in C++17 and brings a lot of experience from boost::optional that was available for many years. Since C++17 you can just #include <optional> and use the type. Such wrapper is still a value type (so you can copy it, via deep copy). What\u2019s more,  std::optional doesn\u2019t need to allocate any memory on the free store. std::optional is a part of C++ vocabulary types along with std::any, std::variant and std::string_view. Usually, you can use an optional wrapper in the following scenarios: I like the description from boost optional which summarizes when we should use the type: From the boost::optional documentation: When to use Optional It is recommended to use optional<T> in situations where there is exactly one, clear (to all parties) reason for having no value of type T, and where the lack of value is as natural as having any regular value of T While sometimes the decision to use optional might be blurry, you shouldn\u2019t use it for error handling. As it best suits the cases when the value is empty and it\u2019s a normal state of the program. Here\u2019s a simple example of what you can do with optional: In the above code we define a function that returns optional containing a string. If the user\u2019s nickname is available, then it will return a string. If not, then it returns nullopt. Later we can assign it to an optional and check (it converts to bool) if it contains any value or not. Optional defines operator* so we can easily access the contained value. In the following sections you\u2019ll see how to createstd::optional, operate on it, pass around and even what is the performance cost you might want to consider. This article is part of my series about C++17 Library Utilities. Here\u2019s the list of the other topics that I\u2019ll cover: Resources about C++17 STL: OK, so let\u2019s move to std::optional. There are several ways to create std::optional: As you can see in the above code sample, you have a lot of flexibility with the creation of optional. It\u2019s very simple for primitive types and this simplicity is extended for even complex types. The \u201cin_place\u201d construction is especially interesting, and the tag std::in_place is also supported in other types like any and variant. For example, you can write: This saves the creation of a temporary Point object. I\u2019ll address std::in_place later in a separate post, so stay tuned. If you return an optional from a function, then it\u2019s very convenient to return just std::nullopt or the computed value. In the above example you can see that I return std::string computed from input.asString() and it\u2019s wrapped in optional. If the value is unavailable then you can just return std::nullopt. Of course, you can also declare an empty optional at the beginning of your function and reassign if you have the computed value. So we could rewrite the above example as: It probably depends on the context which version is better. I prefer short functions, so I\u2019d chose the first option (with multiple returns). Probably the most important operation for optional (apart from creation) is the way how you can fetch the contained value. There are several options: To check if the value is present you can use has_value() method or just check if (optional) as optional is automatically converted to bool. Here\u2019s an example: So the most useful way is probably just to check if the value is there and then access it: Let\u2019s see what are other operations on the type: If you have existing optional object, then you can easily change the contained value by using several operations like emplace, reset, swap, assign. If you assign (or reset) with a nullopt then if the optional contains a value its destructor will be called. Here\u2019s a little summary: The code is available here: @Coliru std::optional allows you to compare contained objects almost \u201cnormally\u201d, but with a few exceptions when the operands are nullopt. See below: The above code generates: The code is available here: @Coliru Here are two a few longer examples where std::optional fits nicely. The code is available here: @Coliru The code is available here: @Coliru The above code uses optional to indicate if we performed the conversion or not. Note that we in fact converted exceptions handling into optional, so we skip the errors that might appear. This might be \u201ccontroversial\u201d as usually, we should report errors. When you use std::optional you\u2019ll pay with increased memory footprint. At least one extra byte is needed. Conceptually your version of the standard library might implement optional as: In short optional just wraps your type, prepares a space for it and then adds one boolean parameter. This means it will extend the size of your Type according do the alignment rules. There was one comment about this construction: \"And no standard library can implement optional this way (they need to use a union, because constexpr)\". So the code above is only to show an example, not real implementation. Alignment rules are important as The standard defines: Class template optional [optional.optional]: \n  The contained value shall be allocated in a region of the optional storage suitably aligned for the type T. For example: While bool type usually takes only one byte, the optional type need to obey the alignment rules and thus the whole wrapper is larger than just sizeof(YourType) + 1 byte. For example, if you have a type like: it will take more space than when you use your custom type: In the first case, we\u2019re using 32 bytes! The second version is 24 bytes. Test code using Compiler Explorer Here\u2019s a great description about the performance and memory layout taken from boost documentation: Performance considerations - 1.67.0. And in Efficient optional values | Andrzej\u2019s C++ blog the author discusses how to write a custom optional wrapper that might be a bit faster I wonder if there\u2019s a chance to do some compiler magic and reuse some space and fit this extra \u201cinitialized flag\u201d inside the wrapped type. So no extra space would be needed. std::optional was adapted directly from boost::optional, so you should see the same experience in both versions. Moving from one to another should be easy, but of course, there are little differences. In the paper: N3793 - A proposal to add a utility class to represent optional objects (Revision 4) -  from 2013-10-03 I\u2019ve found the following table (and I tried to correct it when possible with the current state). While you can use optional on any type you need to pay special attention when trying to wrap boolean or pointers. std::optional<bool> ob - what does it model? With such construction you basically have a tri-state bool. So if you really need it, then maybe it\u2019s better to look for a real tri-state bool like boost::tribool. Whet\u2019s more it might be confusing to use such type because ob converts to bool if there\u2019s a value inside and *ob returns that stored value (if available). Similarly you have a similar confusion with pointers: The pointer to int is naturally \u201cnullable\u201d, so wrapping it into optional makes it very hard to use. Uff\u2026 ! it was a lot of text about optional, but still it\u2019s not all :) Yet, we\u2019ve covered the basic usage, creation and operations of this useful wrapper type. I believe we have a lot of cases where optional fits perfectly and much better than using some predefined values to represent nullable types. I\u2019d like to remember the following things about std::optional: In the next article I\u2019ll try to explain error handling and why optional is maybe not the best choice there.

Ross G. Strachan \/ Flickr Our spring issue will be out later this month, subscribe or renew today! The word Victorian tends to evoke old-fashioned ideas: women confined in corsets, strict gender roles, and a prudishness about all things sexual. In a world where conspicuous consumerism and self-expression rule, these nineteenth-century notions of self-restraint and self-denial seem hopelessly outdated. But the Victorian ethos is not dead, not by a long shot. It lives on, manifesting itself in our contemporary upper middle class\u2019s behavior. While some aspects have gone the way of the waistcoat, the belief that the bourgeoisie holds a place of moral superiority over the other classes persists. Today, spin classes, artisanal food, and the college application process have replaced Sunday promenades, evening lectures, and weekly salons. But make no mistake, they serve the same purpose: transforming class privilege into individual virtue, thereby shoring up social dominance. Historian Peter Gay used \u201cVictorian\u201d to broadly describe the culture of the educated upper middle classes of Western Europe and the United States in the long nineteenth century. Of course, they held much more complicated beliefs about sex, gender, and family than we paint them to have. Victorians may have enforced a strict moral code, but they talked about sex all the time, almost obsessively. As Gay pointed out, wealthy couples often wrote love letters with more steam than a Newcomen engine. And despite stereotypes of stern, authoritarian fathers, this period ushered in contemporary notions of parenting. A real man not only provided for his family, but also took an active interest in his children\u2019s emotional well-being. Although the nineteenth-century upper middle class was not nearly as prudish and stern as we imagine, it did adhere to strict behavioral codes. These normative codes reflected the period\u2019s shifting class structure and the ascendant bourgeoisie\u2019s desire to assert its moral superiority over the nobility, using virtue to challenge the old aristocracy\u2019s place at the center of political, social, and cultural life. While the sons of the gentry hunted and dined, the sons of bankers and lawyers worked, built families, and educated themselves. In Germany, the key word is almost untranslatable: Bildung, which means education in the form of personal cultivation and improvement. That idea, expressed in different languages in different nations, tied this rising class together across national borders. Self-improvement differentiated them from the decadent 1 percent. For example, listening to music became an educational \u2014 rather than entertaining \u2014 experience. The eighteenth century\u2019s classical chamber music functioned as a pleasant soundtrack for aristocratic soirees. At concert halls, the nobility would canoodle in their boxes, only half paying attention to the performers. But when the rising capitalist class attended concerts, they did not gab away in a convivial fashion: they sat still and demanded silence, in order to concentrate on the music. German Victorians coined the term Sitzfleisch \u2014 sitting flesh \u2014 to describe the muscle control required for sitting absolutely still during a concert performance. Even coughs and sneezes had to be stifled, lest they break anyone\u2019s concentration and derail self-improvement. The quest for Bildung saturated daily life as well. Wealthy young women, who could not hope for any career beyond wife and mother, learned at least one other language and took piano and singing lessons. Men often spent their evenings attending lectures or participating in civic organizations. For this dedication to pay off, however, these enriched Victorians had to display it, making their difference from both the wealthier and the poorer obvious to all. They spent a fearsome percentage of their incomes on home d\u00e9cor that showed affluence, taste, and modesty simultaneously. They knew that they had made it once they had a salon \u2014 a room in the house devoted entirely to entertaining guests that the residents would never enter alone. On Sundays, the entire family would promenade through the park. In fact, across Europe and the United States, wealthy families pushed for the construction of more and more public parks. But, in line with their values, these spaces were not intended as commons that anyone could enjoy but as stages to show off their Sunday best. New York\u2019s Central Park, for example, forbade the public from going on the grass or playing sports. Children had to produce a \u201ccertificate of good behavior\u201d from their school before they were allowed on playgrounds. Beer sales were banned on Sundays. The park wasn\u2019t for working-class leisure, but discipline. There, laborers learned to appreciate the proper way to enjoy the park: the stroll. Fredrick Law Olmsted\u2019s early park served as a massive temple to the Victorian notion of nature as a site of improvement. While we don\u2019t often see men in top hats and women in petticoats parading their children on Sundays, parks remain a place to display virtue and discipline: contemporary fitness culture perfectly embodies the nineteenth-century ethos of improvement and discipline. Victorians were famously averse to physical activity \u2014 which was for the proles \u2014 and they saw carrying extra weight as a marker of class and respectability. Fitness and sport began to infiltrate middle-class life in the twentieth century, and today serves the same function as the promenade. This first struck me nine years ago. I was living in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and enjoyed riding my bike as a way to explore an unfamiliar place. One day, I decided to visit East Grand Rapids, a very wealthy suburb, because it has a bike path around Reeds Lake. Once I arrived, I immediately realized that I was the only person not wearing exercise clothing. This is not to say everyone was exercising \u2014 most were out for a stroll, much like their predecessors \u2014 but they were dressed for the gym. The other cyclists all wore tight-fitting spandex outfits, as if they were at the starting line of the Tour de France. These clothes were sending a message: \u201cMake no mistake, we are not walking or riding bikes for transportation. This is exercise.\u201d The wealthy residents of East Grand Rapids had turned a walk in the park into a fitness routine; their athleisure wear proclaimed that this activity was an act of improvement. Current exercise trends, like hot yoga, spin, and CrossFit, all demonstrate a commitment to self-denial and self-discipline, values much praised by the Victorians. Marathon running has become the ultimate signifier: competitors can post photos on social media to prove to everyone that they have tortured their bodies in a highly virtuous \u2014 and not at all kinky \u2014 fashion. This seeps over into everyday activities as well. Trader Joe\u2019s and Whole Foods are filled with people dressed in workout gear with no sweat in sight. This clothing marks its wearers as the type of people who care for their bodies, even when they aren\u2019t exercising. Yoga pants and running shoes display virtue just as clearly as the nineteenth-century wives\u2019 corseted dresses did. Being fit now indexes class, saturating both fitness and food culture. As calories have become cheaper, obesity has changed from being a sign of wealth to a sign of moral failure. Today, being unhealthy functions as a hallmark of the poor\u2019s cupidity the same way working-class sexual mores were viewed in the nineteenth century. Both lines of thinking assert that the lower classes cannot control themselves, so they deserve exactly what they have and nothing more. No need, then, for higher wages or subsidized health care. After all, the poor will just waste it on cigarettes and cheeseburgers. Both then and now, these purported health differences register disgust with working-class bodies. In The Road To Wigan Pier, George Orwell discussed his late-Victorian upbringing, writing that he was trained to believe \u201cthat there was something subtly repulsive about a working-class body.\u201d In Orwell\u2019s time, soap \u2014 not fitness \u2014 made that distinction; he was taught that, in his words, \u201cthe lower classes smell.\u201d Nowadays, the Internet registers cross-class horror on websites like People of Wal-Mart. Instead of being repulsed by the \u201cgreat unwashed,\u201d the modern Victorians blanch at the \u201cgreat overfed.\u201d While the nineteenth-century bourgeoisie saw full figures not as embarrassments to be eradicated, but as comforting signs of their prosperity, their spiritual descendants are obsessed with eating the right kinds of food. In the last fifteen years, organic food has gone from fringe phenomenon to absolute necessity. Consider the gluten-free movement \u2014 those who choose to eliminate gluten from their diet, not those who have celiac disease and must eschew wheat entirely. A few years ago, I joked that finding a gluten-free resident in my rural Nebraska hometown would have been akin to finding the collected works of Peter Kropotkin in the local library. Now \u201cgluten- free\u201d food appears on nearly every local supermarket shelf. This food discipline is a form of virtuous self-denial that would have made the Victorians proud. If only my grandparents had lived long enough to realize that growing their own potatoes and cucumbers made them high class, not hicks. A similar dynamic infects family life today. Like their ancestors, today\u2019s upper middle classes place a great deal of emphasis on the family. Although nineteenth-century authoritarianism has fallen away, this period first saw childhood as a distinct and special period in life. Parents acted accordingly, setting aside nurseries in their homes for their children. Child-rearing practices get more onerous with each passing year, demanding that parents exercise extreme discipline and self-denial. A recent book \u2014 All Joy And No Fun\u00a0\u2014 sounds like music to a Victorian\u2019s ears. What could be more frivolous and less educational than fun? There\u2019s no time for it amidst the demands of modern parenting. Mothers must breast-feed for an extended period, provide only organic food to their children, and keep screen time to nil. Slip-ups indicate failure. This represents perhaps the clearest link between Victorian values then and now: both restrict women and reinforce gender hierarchy. It is hardly coincidental that these new expectations require money and time. A working mother who has to juggle multiple service-sector jobs will find it much harder to pump breast milk at work than a woman in an office job. (Not to mention the disparity in parental leave between white- and blue-collar workers.) The moralistic imperatives now attached to breast-feeding allow working-class women \u2014 who are less likely to breast-feed \u2014 to be judged moral failures. Indeed, public battles over breast-feeding restrictions rarely extend to demands for better lactation access for working-class women. Intensive parenting expectations continue well after children leave infancy. Young children are encouraged to participate in costly club sports, and parents to give up their free time to support them. These activities take time and money, two resources working people lack. This proliferation of organized activities represents a form of improvement: a child\u2019s free time is now completely subsumed by Bildung. And the ability to provide these opportunities to kids is portrayed as a reflection of a family\u2019s morality, not their economic situation. Just as Victorian women had to learn to play the piano and speak Italian \u2014 showing off a refinement unavailable to the other levels of society \u2014 modern kids play soccer, learn Mandarin, and volunteer at a local charity. But the capstone of the modern quest for Bildung is surely the college application process. There is no good nineteenth-century analogue for this ridiculous new ritual, although Dickens would\u2019ve been perfectly able to satirize its inherent absurdity: Millions act as if a system weighted very heavily toward privilege is in fact some kind of meritocracy, and that a person\u2019s worth can be judged by the prestige of the school where they have been accepted. Most Americans who go to college only apply to a couple of schools. But upper-class children take standardized test prep classes, intern or travel over the summer to have material for their entrance essays, and often apply to a dozen schools, all to maximize their chances at getting into the one with the best name. Parents \u2014 no matter their children\u2019s actual intellectual capacities \u2014 can then rest easy in the knowledge they are of a better sort than the plebs who attend Directional State U. Today\u2019s upper middle class maintains the fiction of a meritocratic society, just as the Victorians did. This story allows them to shore up their economic position behind the backs of workers, who are taught that their health problems and dismal career prospects represent individual faults, not systemic dysfunction. Of course, exercising, eating organic food, and pushing children to use their spare time usefully are not inherently bad things. However, they become markers of bourgeois values when they are marshaled to assert one class\u2019s moral superiority over another and to justify social inequality. It was just as obnoxious in the nineteenth century as it is today. We should care about health, food, and education. But instead of seeing them as ways to prop up class dominance, we should improve them for everyone. Imagine if all of the energy used to get mediocre, upper-class children into prestigious colleges was redirected into making higher education more accessible and affordable across the board. Imagine if access to healthy food for all was prioritized over attaining status through buying the most virtuous products. Imagine, in short, what our world would look like if socialist values \u2014 not Victorian ones \u2014 dominated.

When I read this, my first reaction was that it was absurdly wrong and laughable.\u00a0 I confess that I was even\u00a0angry, to see something so counter to everything I knew asserted with such blithe professorial confidence.\u00a0 Yet, in a theme that will surely be familiar with anyone who\u2019s engaged with Robin or his writing, I struggled to articulate exactly\u00a0why the argument was wrong.\u00a0 My first guess was that, just like typical straitjacketed economists, Robin and Tyler had simply forgotten that real humans lack unlimited time to think and converse with each other.\u00a0 Putting those obvious limitations back into the theory, I felt, would surely reinstate the verdict of common sense, that of course two people can agree to disagree without violating any dictates of rationality. Now, if only I\u2019d had the benefit of a modern education on Twitter and Facebook, I would\u2019ve known that I could\u2019ve stopped right there, with the first counterargument that popped into my head.\u00a0 I could\u2019ve posted something like the following on all my social media accounts: \u201cHanson and Cowen, typical narrow-minded economists, ludicrously claim that rational agents with common priors can\u2019t agree to disagree.\u00a0They stupidly ignore the immense communication and computation that reaching agreement would take.\u00a0 Why are these clowns allowed to teach?\u00a0 SAD!\u201d Alas, back in 2003, I hadn\u2019t yet been exposed to the epistemological revolution wrought by the 280-character smackdown, so I got the idea into my head that I actually needed to prove my objection was as devastating as I thought.\u00a0 So I sat down with pen and paper for some hours\u2014and discovered, to my astonishment, that my objection didn\u2019t work at all.\u00a0 According to my complexity-theoretic refinement of Aumann\u2019s agreement theorem, which I later published in STOC\u20192005, two Bayesian agents with a common prior can ensure that they agree to within\u00a0\u00b1\u03b5 about the value of a [0,1]-valued random variable, with probability at least 1-\u03b4 over their shared prior, by exchanging only O(1\/(\u03b4\u03b52)) bits of information\u2014completely independent of how much knowledge the agents have.\u00a0 My conclusion was that, if Aumann\u2019s Nobel-prizewinning theorem fails to demonstrate the irrationality of real-life disagreements, then it\u2019s not for reasons of computational or communication efficiency; it has to be for other reasons instead.\u00a0 (See also my talk on this at the SPARC summer camp.) In my and Robin\u2019s conversations\u2014first about Aumann\u2019s theorem, then later about the foundations of quantum mechanics and AI and politics and everything else you can imagine\u2014Robin was unbelievably generous with his time and insights, willing to spend days with me, then a totally unknown postdoc, to get to the bottom of whatever was the dispute at hand.\u00a0 When I visited Robin at George Mason, I got to meet his wife and kids, and see for myself the almost comical contrast between the conventional nature of his family life and the destabilizing radicalism (some would say near-insanity) of his thinking.\u00a0 But I\u2019ll say this for Robin: I\u2019ve met many eccentric intellectuals in my life, but I have yet to meet\u00a0anyone whose curiosity is more genuine than Robin\u2019s, or whose doggedness in following a chain of reasoning is more untouched by considerations of what all the cool people will say about him at the other end. So if you believe that the life of the mind benefits from a true diversity of opinions, from thinkers who defend positions that actually differ in novel and interesting ways from what everyone else is saying\u2014then no matter how vehemently you disagree with any of his views, Robin seems like the prototype of what you want more of in academia.\u00a0 To anyone who claims that Robin\u2019s apparent incomprehension of moral taboos, his puzzlement about social norms, are mere affectations masking some sinister Koch-brothers agenda, I reply: I\u2019ve known Robin for years, and while I might be ignorant of many things, on this I know you\u2019re mistaken.\u00a0 Call him wrongheaded, na\u00efve, tone-deaf, insensitive, even an asshole, but don\u2019t ever accuse him of insincerity or hidden agendas.\u00a0 Are his open, stated agendas not wild enough for you?? In my view, any assessment of Robin\u2019s abrasive, tone-deaf, and sometimes even offensive intellectual style has to grapple with the fact that, over his career, Robin has originated not one but several hugely\u00a0important ideas\u2014and his ability to do so strikes me as clearly\u00a0related to his style, not easily detachable from it.\u00a0 Most famously, Robin is one of the major developers of prediction markets, and also the inventor of\u00a0futarchy\u2014a proposed system of government that would harness prediction markets to get well-calibrated assessments of the effects of various policies.\u00a0 Robin also first articulated the concept of the Great Filter in the evolution of life in our universe.\u00a0 It\u2019s Great Filter reasoning that tells us, for example, that if we ever discover fossil microbial life on Mars (or worse yet, simple plants and animals on extrasolar planets), then we should be terrified, because it would mean that several solutions to the Fermi paradox that don\u2019t involve civilizations like ours killing themselves off would have been eliminated.\u00a0 Sure, once you say it, it sounds pretty obvious \u2026 but did you think of it? Earlier this year, Robin published a book together with Kevin Simler, entitled The Elephant In The Brain: Hidden Motives In Everyday Life.\u00a0 I was happy to provide feedback on the manuscript and then to offer a jacket blurb (though the publisher cut nearly everything I wrote, leaving only that I considered the book \u201ca masterpiece\u201d).\u00a0 The book\u2019s basic thesis is that a huge fraction of human behavior, possibly the majority of it, is less about its ostensible purpose than about signalling what kind of people we are\u2014and that this has implications for healthcare and education spending, among many other topics.\u00a0 (Thus, the book covers some of the same ground as The Case Against Education, by Robin\u2019s GMU colleague Bryan Caplan, which I blogged about here.) I view The Elephant In The Brain as Robin\u2019s finest work so far, though a huge part of the credit surely goes to Kevin Simler.\u00a0 Robin\u2019s writing style tends to be \u2026 spare.\u00a0 telegraphic.\u00a0 He gives you the skeleton of an argument, but leaves it to you to add the flesh, the historical context and real-world examples and caveats.\u00a0 And he never holds your hand by saying anything like: \u201cI know this is going to sound weird, but\u2026\u201d\u00a0 Robin doesn\u2019t care how weird it sounds.\u00a0 With EITB, you get the best of both worlds: Robin\u2019s unique-on-this-planet trains of logic, and Kevin\u2019s considerable gifts at engaging prose.\u00a0 It\u2019s a powerful combination. I\u2019m by no means an unqualified Hanson fan.\u00a0 If you\u2019ve ever felt completely infuriated by Robin\u2014if you\u2019ve ever thought, fine, maybe this guy turned out to be unpopularly right some other times, but this time he\u2019s really just being willfully and even dangerously obtuse\u2014then know that I\u2019ve shared that feeling more than most over the past decade.\u00a0 I recall in particular a lecture that Robin gave years ago in which he argued\u2014and I apologize to Robin if I mangle a detail, but this was definitely the essence\u2014that even if\u00a0you grant that anthropogenic climate change will destroy human civilization and most complex ecosystems hundreds of years from now, that\u2019s not necessarily something you should worry about, because if you apply the standard exponential time-discounting that economists apply to everything else, along with reasonable estimates for the monetary value of everything on earth, you discover that all life on earth centuries from now just isn\u2019t worth very much in today\u2019s dollars. On hearing this, the familiar Hanson-emotions filled me: White-hot, righteous rage.\u00a0 Zeal to cut Robin down, put him in his place, for the sake of all that\u2019s decent in humanity.\u00a0 And then \u2026 confusion about where exactly his argument fails. For whatever it\u2019s worth, I\u2019d probably say today that Robin is wrong on this, because economists\u2019 exponential discounting implicitly assumes that civilization\u2019s\u00a0remarkable progress of the last few centuries will continue unabated, which is the very point that the premise of the exercise denies.\u00a0 But notice what I can\u2019t say: \u201cshut up Robin, we\u2019ve all heard this right-wing libertarian nonsense before.\u201d\u00a0 Even when Robin spouts nonsense, it\u2019s often nonsense that\u00a0no one\u00a0has heard before, brought back from intellectual continents that wouldn\u2019t be on the map had Robin not existed. So why am I writing about Robin now?\u00a0 If you haven\u2019t been living in a non-wifi-equipped cave, you probably know the answer. A week ago, alas, Robin blogged his confusion about why the people most concerned about inequalities of wealth, never seem to be concerned about inequalities of romantic and sexual fulfillment\u2014even though, in other contexts, those same people would probably affirm that relationships are much more important to their personal happiness than wealth is.\u00a0 As a predictable result of his prodding this angriest hornet\u2019s-nest on the planet, Robin has now been pilloried all over the Internet, in terms that make the attacks on me three years ago over the comment-171 affair look tender and kind by comparison.\u00a0 The attacks included a Slate hit-piece entitled \u201cIs Robin Hanson America\u2019s Creepiest Economist?\u201d\u00a0(though see also this in-depth followup interview), a Wonkette post entitled \u201cThis Week In Garbage Men: Incels Sympathizers [sic] Make Case for Redistribution of Vaginas,\u201d\u00a0and much more.\u00a0 Particularly on Twitter, Robin\u2019s attackers have tended to use floridly profane language, and to target his physical appearance and assumed sexual proclivities and frustrations; some call for his firing or death.\u00a0 I won\u2019t link to the stuff; you can find it. Interestingly, many of the Twitter attacks assume that Robin himself\u00a0must be an angry \u201cincel\u201d (short for \u201cinvoluntary celibate\u201d), since who else could treat that particular form of human suffering as worthy of reply?\u00a0 Few seem to have done the 10-second research to learn that, in reality, Robin is a happily married father of two. I noticed the same strange phenomenon during the comment-171 affair: commentators on both left and right wanted to make me the poster child for \u201cincels,\u201d with a few offering me advice, many swearing they would\u2019ve guessed it immediately from my photograph.\u00a0 People apparently didn\u2019t read just a few paragraphs into my story\u2014to the part where, once I finally acquired some of the norms that mainstream culture refuses to tell people, I enjoyed a normal or even good dating life, eventually marrying a brilliant fellow theoretical computer scientist, with whom I started raising a rambunctious daughter (who\u2019s now 5, and who\u2019s been joined by our 1-year-old son).\u00a0 If not for this happy ending, I too might have entertained my critics\u2019 elaborate theories about my refusal to accept my biological inferiority, my simply having lost the genetic lottery (ability to do quantum computing research notwithstanding).\u00a0 But what can one do faced with the facts? For the record: I think that Robin should never, ever have made this comparison, and I wish he\u2019d apologize for it now.\u00a0 Had he asked my advice, I would\u2019ve screamed \u201cDON\u2019T DO IT\u201d at the top of my lungs.\u00a0 I once contemplated such a comparison myself\u2014and even though it was many years ago, in the depths of a terrifying relapse of the suicidal depression that had characterized much of my life, I still count it among my greatest regrets.\u00a0 I hereby renounce and disown the comparison forever.\u00a0 And I beg forgiveness from anyone who was hurt or offended by it\u2014or for that matter, by anything else I ever said, on this blog or elsewhere. Indeed, let me go further: if you were ever hurt or offended by anything I said, and if I can make partial restitution to you by taking some time to field your questions about quantum computing and information, or math, CS, and physics more generally, or academic career advice, or anything else where I\u2019m said to know something, please shoot me an email.\u00a0 I\u2019m also open to donating to your favorite charity. My view is this: the world in which a comparison between the sufferings of the romantically and the monetarily impoverished could increase normal people\u2019s understanding of the former, is so different from our world as to be nearly unrecognizable.\u00a0 To say that this comparison is outside the Overton window is a comic understatement: it\u2019s outside the Overton galaxy.\u00a0\u00a0Trying to have the conversation that Robin wanted to have on social media, is a little like trying to have a conversation about microaggressions in 1830s Alabama.\u00a0 At first, your listeners will simply be confused\u2014but their confusion will be highly unstable, like a Higgs boson, and will decay in about 10-22 seconds into righteous rage. For experience shows that, if you even breathe a phrase like \u201cthe inequality of romantic and sexual fulfillment,\u201d no one\u00a0who isn\u2019t weird in certain ways common in the hard sciences (e.g., being on the autism spectrum) will be able to parse you as saying anything other than that sex ought to be \u201credistributed\u201d by the government in the same way that money is redistributed, which in turn suggests a dystopian horror scenario where women are treated like property, married against their will, and raped.\u00a0 And it won\u2019t help if you shout from the rooftops that you want nothing of this kind, oppose it as vehemently as your listeners do.\u00a0 For, not knowing what else you could mean, the average person will continue to impose the nightmare scenario on anything you say, and will add evasiveness and dishonesty to the already severe charges against you. Before going any further in this post, let me now say that any male who wants to call himself my ideological ally ought to agree to the following statement. I hold the bodily autonomy of women\u2014the principle that women are freely-willed agents rather than the chattel they were treated as for too much of human history; that they, not their fathers or husbands or anyone else, are the sole rulers of their bodies; and that they must never under any circumstances be touched without their consent\u2014to be my Zeroth Commandment, the foundation-stone of my moral worldview, the starting point of every action I take and every thought I think.\u00a0 This principle of female bodily autonomy, for me, deserves to be chiseled onto tablets of sapphire, placed in a golden ark adorned with winged cherubim sitting atop a pedestal inside the Holy of Holies in a temple on Mount Moriah. This, or something close to it, is really what I believe.\u00a0 And I advise any lonely young male nerd who might be reading this blog to commit to the Zeroth Commandment as well, and to the precepts of feminism more broadly. To such a nerd, I say: yes, throughout your life you\u2019ll encounter many men and women who will despise you for being different, in ways that you\u2019re either powerless to change, or could change only at the cost of renouncing everything you are.\u00a0 Yet, far from excusing any moral lapses on your part, this hatred simply means that you need to adhere to a higher moral standard than most people.\u00a0 For whenever you stray even slightly from the path of righteousness, the people who detest nerds will leap excitedly, seeing irrefutable proof of all their prejudices.\u00a0 Do not grant them that victory.\u00a0 Do not create a Shanda fur die Normies. I wish I believed in a God who could grant you some kind of eternal salvation, in return for adhering to a higher moral standard throughout your life, and getting in return at best grudging toleration, as well as lectures about your feminist failings by guys who\u2019ve obeyed the Zeroth Commandment about a thousandth as scrupulously as you have.\u00a0 As an atheist, though, the most I can offer you is that you can probably understand the proof of Cantor\u2019s theorem, while most of those who despise you probably can\u2019t.\u00a0 And also: as impossible as it might seem right now, there are ways that even you can pursue the ordinary, non-intellectual kinds of happiness in life, and there will be many individuals along the way ready to help you: the ones who remember their humanity and forget their ideology.\u00a0 I wish you the best. Amid the many vitriolic responses to Robin\u2014fanned, it must be admitted, by Robin\u2019s own refusal to cede any ground to his critics, or to modulate his style or tone in the slightest\u2014the one striking outlier was a\u00a0New York Times essay by Ross Douthat.\u00a0 This essay, which has itself now been widely panned, uses Robin as an example of how, in Douthat\u2019s words, \u201c[s]ometimes the extremists and radicals and weirdos see the world more clearly than the respectable and moderate and sane.\u201c\u00a0 Douthat draws an interesting parallel between Robin and the leftist feminist philosopher Amia Srinivasan, who recently published a beautifully-written essay in the London Review of Books entitled Does anyone have the right to sex?\u00a0 In analyzing that question, Srinivasan begins by discussing male \u201cincels,\u201d but then shifts her attention to far more sympathetic cases: women and men suffering severe physical or mental disabilities (and who, in some countries, can already hire sexual surrogates with government support); who were disfigured by accidents; who are treated as undesirable for racist reasons.\u00a0 Let me quote from her conclusion: The question, then, is how to dwell in the ambivalent place where we acknowledge that no one is obligated to desire anyone else, that no one has a right to be desired, but also that who is desired and who isn\u2019t is a political question, a question usually answered by more general patterns of domination and exclusion \u2026\u00a0the radical self-love movements among black, fat and disabled women do ask us to treat our sexual preferences as less than perfectly fixed. \u2018Black is beautiful\u2019 and \u2018Big is beautiful\u2019 are not just slogans of empowerment, but proposals for a revaluation of our values \u2026\u00a0The question posed by radical self-love movements is not whether there is a right to sex (there isn\u2019t), but whether there is a duty to transfigure, as best we can, our desires. All over social media, there are howls of outrage that Douthat would dare to mention Srinivasan\u2019s essay, which is wise and nuanced and humane, in the same breath as the gross, creepy, entitled rantings of Robin Hanson.\u00a0 I would say: grant that Srinivasan and Hanson express themselves extremely differently, and also that Srinivasan is a trillion times better than Hanson at anticipating and managing her readers\u2019 reactions.\u00a0 Still, on the merits, is there any relevant difference between the two cases beyond: \u201cundesirability\u201d of the disabled, fat, and trans should be critically examined and interrogated, because those people are objects of progressive sympathy; whereas \u201cundesirability\u201d of nerdy white and Asian males should be taken as a brute fact or even celebrated, because those\u00a0people are objects of progressive contempt? To be fair, a Google search also turns up progressives who, dissenting from the above consensus, excoriate Srinivasan for her foray, however thoughtful, into taboo territory.\u00a0 As best I can tell, the dissenters\u2019 argument runs like so: as much as it might pain us, we must\u00a0not show any compassion to women and men who are suicidally lonely and celibate by virtue of being severely disabled, disfigured, trans, or victims of racism.\u00a0 For if we did, then consistency might eventually force us to show compassion to white male nerds as well. Here\u2019s the central point that I think Robin failed to understand: society, today, is not on board even with the minimal claim that the suicidal suffering of men left behind by the sexual revolution really exists\u2014or, if it does, that it\u00a0matters in the slightest\u00a0or deserves any sympathy or acknowledgment whatsoever.\u00a0 Indeed, the men in question pretty much need\u00a0to be demonized as entitled losers and creeps, because if they weren\u2019t, then sympathy for them\u2014at least, for those among them who are friends, coworkers, children, siblings\u2014might become hard to prevent.\u00a0 In any event, it seems to me that until we as a society resolve the preliminary question, of whether to recognize a certain category of suffering as real, there\u2019s no point even discussing how policy or culture might help to address the suffering, consistently with the Zeroth Commandment. Seen in this light, Robin is a bit like the people who email me every week imagining they can prove P\u2260NP, yet who can\u2019t even prove astronomically easier statements, even ones that are already known.\u00a0 When trying to scale an intellectual Everest, you might as well start with the weakest\u00a0statement that\u2019s already unproven or non-obvious or controversial. So where are we today?\u00a0 Within the current Overton window,\u00a0a perfectly appropriate response to suicidal loneliness and depression among the \u201cprivileged\u201d (i.e., straight, able-bodied, well-educated white or Asian men) seems to be: \u201cjust kill yourselves already, you worthless cishet scum, and remove your garbage DNA from the gene pool.\u201d\u00a0 If you think I\u2019m exaggerating, I beseech you to check for yourself on Twitter.\u00a0 I predict you\u2019ll find that and much worse, wildly upvoted, by people who probably go to sleep every night congratulating themselves for their progressivism, their egalitarianism, and\u2014of course\u2014their burning hatred for anything that smacks of eugenics. A few days ago, Ellen Pao, the influential former CEO of Reddit, tweeted: CEOs of big tech companies: You almost certainly have incels as employees. What are you going to do about it? Thankfully, even many leftists reacted with horror to Pao\u2019s profoundly illiberal question.\u00a0 They wondered about the logistics she had in mind: does she want tech companies to spy on their (straight, male) employees\u2019 sex lives, or lack thereof?\u00a0 If any are discovered who are (1) celibate and (2) bitter at the universe about it, then will it be an adequate defense against firing if they\u2019re also feminists, who condemn misogyny and violence and affirm the Zeroth Commandment?\u00a0 Is it not enough that these men were permanently denied the third level of Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs\u00a0(the one right above physical safety); must they also\u00a0be denied careers as a result?\u00a0 And is this supposed to prevent their radicalization? For me, the scariest part of Pao\u2019s proposal is that, whatever in this field is on the leftmost fringe of the Overton window today, experience suggests we\u2019ll find it smack in the center a decade from now.\u00a0 So picture a future wherein, if you don\u2019t support rounding up and firing your company\u2019s romantically frustrated\u2014i.e., the policy of \u201cif you don\u2019t get laid, you don\u2019t get paid\u201d\u2014then that itself is a shockingly reactionary attitude, and grounds for your own dismissal. Some people might defend Pao by pointing out that she was only asking a question, not proposing a specific policy.\u00a0 But then, the same is true of Robin Hanson. Why is it so politically difficult even to show empathy toward socially awkward, romantically challenged men\u2014to say to them,\u00a0\u201clook, I don\u2019t know what if anything can be done about your problem, but yeah, the sheer cosmic arbitrariness of it kind of sucks, and I sympathize with you\u201d?\u00a0 Why do enlightened progressives, if they do offer such words of comfort to their \u201cincel\u201d friends, seem to feel about it the same way Huck Finn did, at the pivotal moment in Western literature when he decides to help his friend Jim escape from slavery\u2014i.e., not beaming with pride over his own moral courage, but ashamed\u00a0of himself, and resigned that he\u2019ll burn in hell for the sake of a mere personal friendship? This is a puzzle, but I think I might know the answer.\u00a0 We begin with the observation that virtually every news article, every thinkpiece, every blog post about \u201cincels,\u201d fronts contemptible mass murderers like Elliot Rodger and Alek Minassian, who sought bloody revenge on a world that failed to provide them the women to whom they felt entitled; as well as various Internet forums (many recently shut down) where this subhuman scum was celebrated by other scum. The question is: why don\u2019t people look at the broader picture, as they\u2019ve learned to do in so many other cases?\u00a0 In other words, why don\u2019t they say: The puzzle, again, is: why doesn\u2019t anyone say this? And I think the answer is simply that\u00a0no one ever hears from \u201cmoderate incels.\u201d\u00a0 And the reason, in turn, becomes obvious the instant you think about it.\u00a0 Would you volunteer to march at the front of the Lifelong Celibacy Awareness Parade?\u00a0 Or to be identified by name as the Vice President of the League of Peaceful and Moderate Incels?\u00a0 Would you\u00a0accept such a social death warrant?\u00a0 It takes an individual with extraordinary moral courage, such as Scott Alexander, even to write anything whatsoever about this issue that tries to understand or help the sufferers rather than condemn them.\u00a0 For this reason\u2014i.e., purely, 100% a selection effect, nothing more\u2014the only times the wider world ever hears anything about \u201cincels\u201d is when some despicable lunatic like Rodger or Minassian snaps and murders the innocent.\u00a0 You might call this the worst PR problem in the history of the world. So what\u2019s the solution?\u00a0 While I\u2019m not a Christian, I find that Jesus\u2019 prescription of universal compassion has a great deal to recommend it here\u2014applied liberally, like suntan lotion, to every corner of the bitter \u201cSJW vs. incel\u201d online debate. The usual stereotype of nerds is that, while we might be good at memorizing facts or proving theorems or coding up filesystems, we\u2019re horrendously deficient in empathy and compassion, constantly wanting to reduce human emotions to numbers in spreadsheets or something.\u00a0 As I\u2019ve remarked elsewhere, I\u2019ve scarcely encountered any stereotype that rings falser to my experience.\u00a0 In my younger, depressed phase, when I was metaphorically hanging on to life by my fingernails, it was nerds and social misfits who offered me their hands up, while many of the \u201cnormal, well-adjusted, socially competent\u201d people gleefully stepped on my fingers. But my aspiration is not merely that we nerds can do just as well at compassion as those who hate us.\u00a0 Rather, I hope we can do better.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t actually such an ambitious goal.\u00a0 To achieve it, all we need to do is show universal, Jesus-style compassion, to politically favored and disfavored groups alike. To me that means: compassion for the woman facing sexual harassment, or simply quizzical glances that wonder what she thinks she\u2019s doing pursuing a PhD in physics.\u00a0 Compassion for the cancer patient, for the bereaved parent, for the victim of famine.\u00a0 Compassion for the undocumented immigrant facing deportation.\u00a0 Compassion for the LGBT man or woman dealing with self-doubts, ridicule, and abuse.\u00a0 Compassion for the nerdy male facing suicidal depression because modern dating norms, combined with his own shyness and fear of rule-breaking, have left him unable to pursue romance or love.\u00a0 Compassion for the woman who feels like an ugly, overweight, unlovable freak who no one will ask on dates.\u00a0 Compassion for the African-American victim of police brutality.\u00a0 Compassion even for the pedophile who\u2019d sooner kill himself than hurt a child, but who\u2019s been given no support for curing or managing his condition.\u00a0 This is what I advocate.\u00a0 This is my platform. If I ever decided to believe the portrait of me painted by Arthur Chu, or the other anti-Aaronson Twitter warriors, then I hope I\u2019d have the moral courage to complete their unstated modus ponens, by quietly swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills.\u00a0 After all, Chu\u2019s vision of the ideal future seems to have no more room for me in it than Eichmann\u2019s did.\u00a0 But the paradoxical corollary is that, every time I remind myself why I think Chu is wrong, it feels like a splendorous affirmation of life itself.\u00a0 I affirm my love for my wife and children and parents and brother, my bonds with my friends around the world, the thrill of tackling a new research problem and sharing my progress with colleagues, the joy of mentoring students of every background and religion and gender identity, the smell of fresh-baked soft pretzels and the beauty of the full moon over the Mediterranean.\u00a0 If I had to find pearls in manure, I\u2019d say: with their every attack, the people who hate me give me a brand-new opportunity to choose life over death, and better yet to choose compassion over hatred\u2014even compassion for the haters themselves. (Far be it from me to psychoanalyze him, as he constantly does to me, but Chu\u2019s unremitting viciousness doesn\u2019t strike\u00a0me as coming from a place of any great happiness with his life.\u00a0 So I say: may even Mr. Chu find whatever he\u2019s looking for.\u00a0 And while his utopia might have no place for me, I\u2019m determined that mine should have a place for him\u2014even if it\u2019s just playing Jeopardy!\u00a0and jumping around to find the Daily Doubles.) It\u2019s a commonplace that sometimes, the only way you can get a transformative emotional experience\u2014like awe at watching the first humans walk on the moon, or joy at reuniting with a loved one after a transatlantic flight\u2014is on top of a mountain of coldly rational engineering and planning.\u00a0 But the current Robin Hanson affair reminds us that the converse is true as well.\u00a0 I.e., the only way we can have the sort of austere, logical, norm-flouting conversations about the social world that Robin has been seeking to have for decades, without the whole thing exploding in thermonuclear anger, is on top of a mountain of empathy and compassion.\u00a0 So let\u2019s start building that mountain. Endnotes. Already, in my mind\u2019s eye, I can see the Twitter warriors copying and sharing whichever sentence of this post angered them the most, using it as proof that I\u2019m some lunatic who should never be listened to about anything. I\u2019m practically on my hands and knees begging you here: show that my fears are unjustified.\u00a0 Respond, by all means, but respond to the entirety of what I had to say. I welcome comments, so long as they\u2019re written in a spirit of kindness and mutual respect. But because writing this post was emotionally and spiritually draining for me\u2013not to mention draining in, you know, time\u2014I hope readers won\u2019t mind if I spend a day or two away, with my wife and kids and my research, before participating in the comments myself. Update (May 7).\u00a0Numerous commenters have successfully convinced me that the word \u201cincel,\u201d though it literally just means \u201cinvoluntary celibate,\u201d and was in fact coined by a woman to describe her own experience, has been permanently disgraced by its association with violent misogynists and their online fan clubs.\u00a0 It will never again regain its original meaning, any more than \u201cAdolf\u201d will ever again be just a name; nor will one be able to discuss \u201cmoderate incels\u201d as distinct from the extremist kind.\u00a0 People of conscience will need to be extremely vigilant against motte-and-bailey tactics\u2014wherein society\u2019s opinion-makers will express their desire for all \u201cincels\u201d to be silenced or fired or removed from the gene pool or whatever, obviously having in mind all romantically frustrated male nerds (all of whom they despise), and will fall back when challenged (and\u00a0only\u00a0when challenged) on the defense that they only meant the violence-loving misogynists.\u00a0 For those of us motivated by compassion rather than hatred, though, we need another word.\u00a0 I suggest the older term \u201clove-shy,\u201d coined by Brian Gilmartin in his book on the subject. Meanwhile, be sure to check out this comment by \u201cSniffnoy\u201d for many insightful criticisms of this post, most of which I endorse. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis entry was posted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton Sunday, May 6th, 2018 at 8:02 am\t\t\t\t\t\tand is filed under Obviously I'm Not Defending Aaronson.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n I\u2019m left wing and broke and reasonably content but have often wondered what the psychological consequences would be if someone like me who is not quite Clark Gable in the looks department were robbed of the hope of transcending the \u201cexpected partner\u201d through acquiring wealth being creative or winning in the lottery. \u201c\u201dif you were ever hurt or offended by anything I said [\u2026]. I\u2019m also open to donating to your favorite charity.\u201d Referring to your July 17, 2017 blog entry https:\/\/www.scottaaronson.com\/blog\/?p=3336#comments) and your comment #18 \u201d \u201cIt sounds like all you need to do is explain to people, \u201cI\u2019m not a climate denier, I\u2019m just an asshole\u201d and the exchange #23 and #24 that followed, i would like you to make a donation to my favorite charity. This requires you to send a donation to me (i can e-mail you my address) since i am my favorite charity (according to my wife who supports me with her Trust fund income ). If you don\u2019t accept me as my favorite charity, then i would like you to make a donation (in my name preferably, or in your name) to the Voluntaryist organization (http:\/\/voluntaryist.com\/sample-page\/#.Wu8JrC_MzOQ). Thabks in advance for your kind offer. As one data point, I\u2019ll tell you why this particular reader doesn\u2019t find your three cases (extremist muslims\/moderate muslims; extremist leftists\/moderate leftists; extremist incels\/moderate incels) to serve as a compelling analogy. Just typing the above makes it appear clear to me: there\u2019s no such thing as a moderate incel. There are people who are involuntarily celibate and who would not dream of harming anyone over their unhappiness, but these are not just people who wouldn\u2019t dare \u201ccome out\u201d as incels; they are *not* incels (in the current meaning of the term) at all. To be (and to admit to be, and maybe even to be proud to be) an incel is to blame women for your lack of romantic fulfillment. There is nothing in this person\u2019s worldview that is shared by the merely romantically unfulfilled apart from, well, their romantic unfulfillment. But muslims and extremist muslims share (many elements of) a belief system (while obviously not all of them), and a shared cultural heritage (again, to an extent), and maybe some political grievances. Leftists and extremist leftists share a belief, broadly, about what some of the forces are that cause harm to society (though they do not agree on the fierceness of the appropriate means to right it). Incels, though (in your formulation \u201cextremist incels\u201d), have no real moderate counterpart. You either believe that women owe you love and sex just because you deserve it somehow, and that they are rotten to deny it to you\u2013in which case you are a contemptible incel, whether or not you turn to violence\u2013or you recognise, as a sad single person, that maybe you have some work to do, maybe you even accept that you need to lower your standards, whatever\u2013and in this case you can be involuntary celibate without ascribing at all to \u201cincelhood\u201d. While disagreeing with you, I think you should be commended for taking the time and energy to type out a smart and rational case for what you believe, even all the while knowing that you will be attacked for it, however careful you are. Some comments: 1) Very few people seem to take \u2018bodily autonomy\u2019 very seriously except when it implies their favored policies. Do not resuscitate orders are routinely ignored. People are not permitted to take controlled substances without permission from doctors. The state tries to prevent suicide. Children, especially disadvantaged children, have almost no bodily autonomy in our society. For example Autistic children are routinely abused physically restrained and treated to \u2018aversive\u2019. I think most people know this implicitly. 2) I personally actually do value bodily autonomy very highly. But I would never endorse a \u20180th commandment\u2019 that singles out the bodily autonomy of men. If you made your commandment gender neutral I would endorse it. (and their are many examples of male bodily autonomy being flagrantly violated, for example the draft. Historical comparisons of who \u2018had it worse\u2019 are not useful imo.) I haven\u2019t read this whole post.  I\u2019m just stopping at the discussion of Aumann\u2019s Theorem.  This actually doesn\u2019t surprise me.  Human beings are not, at core, rational actors.  This is my biggest complaint against the likes of Cowen and Hanson. I am not a rational agent.  You aren\u2019t one either.  Of course, there are a lot of people who get very offended at the notion that some of their beliefs are not the product of ratiocination.  I hope you aren\u2019t one, Scott, but it seems as though maybe you are. This is just fundamentally not how human beings work.  Rational thought is something that we are capable of, and it is useful.  But it isn\u2019t, for instance, what drives you to have children. We have brains that are very associational, and our feelings and beliefs are highly path-dependent.  The people in the persuasion business know this well and use it every day.  We mathy types ignore this to our own peril. Re Pao\u2019s tweet, I think you\u2019re misinterpreting it. I get that it\u2019s ripe for misinterpretation, but my sense is that avoiding that would be better for the kind of discourse you want. (And I don\u2019t think two misinterpretations make a right one!) You\u2019ve interpreted \u201cincel\u201d in the tweet as literally \u201cinvoluntarily celebrate\u201d. But in common usage the word seems to mean a bit more than that, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely she meant to fire someone for being celebrate not by choice. At https:\/\/www.urbandictionary.com\/define.php?term=incel, the top two definitions I see include more, eg \u201cfrustrated virgin who feels as if the world owes them sex\u201d. There\u2019s still plenty to worry about with the tweet even interpreted that way, but I wanted to be talking about the right thing. Adding a little more generosity: if someone\u2019s behavior at work shows that they fit the definition I posted, they probably should be fired! Re Comment #1: Definitely not trying to accuse you of weird intentions, but your comment is exactly the type of thing that brings people up in righteous anger. Indeed, I had to swallow my bile before going on a rant for seeing this kind of comment below Scott\u2019s beautiful piece, and you will definitely incite the twitter mob, and your comment will be used to attack Scott in public. Let me explain. Your comment uses \u201cexpected partner\u201d unironically, and appears to imply a mindset that is extremely close to \u201cadversarial sexual marketplace\u201d views, i.e. the disgusting \u201cmanosphere\u201d. The zeroth commandment is not enough: You can be a non-rapist who affirms that consent is kinda important in practice, and still view the world of romance and human relationships in terms of adversarial game-theoretic \u201cmarket value\u201d terms.  This is a huge red flag for people who espouse exactly the kind of ideology that Scott describes as \u201csubhuman scum\u201d. Your comment stinks. I hope that you simply failed communication-wise (like Hanson completely failed at communication). If you communicated correctly, then I wish you the best for recovering from the toxic ideology that has infested your mind, but know that you currently are exactly the kind of person that Scott and the angry twitter-mob can agree on opposing. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Whatever_(novel) edit: Obviously meant to say \u2018singles out the bodily autonomy of women\u2019 in comment #4. When you write of the sacredness of female bodily autonomy, you employ two unnecessary qualifiers.  Autonomy is sacred, full stop.  Its sacredness is perfect across all human life and all aspects of human life.  To qualify it is implicitly to restrict its application to certain groups, which is patently impermissible. But we have created a civilizational system in which autonomy is unattainable for anyone \u2014 so comprehensively unattainable, so unthinkably far out of reach, that any discussion of it automatically becomes a rhetorical trick. The only remaining question is: which trick, on whose behalf?  And the only possible answer is: a pox on all tricks, and on all of their potential beneficiaries. [\u2026] Scott Aaronson in Shtetl-Optimized: \u201cThe Zeroth Commandment\u201c [\u2026] anon #7: This is a warning.  I didn\u2019t find your comment to be \u201cwritten in a spirit of kindness and mutual respect\u201d (and FWIW, I found comment #1 to be more confusing than offense-worthy).  Further comments in the same vein might be left in moderation.  Thanks. Richard #2: I said I was \u201copen\u201d to donating; it very deliberately wasn\u2019t a blanket offer to give money to any group that any commenter might suggest. \ud83d\ude42 If you can suggest a charity consistent with both of our values\u2014which I don\u2019t think should really be that hard\u2014then I\u2019ll donate to it. \u201cRobin blogged his confusion about why the people concerned about inequalities of wealth, never seem to be concerned about inequalities of romantic and sexual fulfillment\u201d  The logical flaw here is that money is assumed to be a commodity, like gold, or bitcoin, or sexual favors if you wish, to be mined from society, rather than the social contract and economic medium that allows billions of people to function as a larger social and economic entity.  When societies were small, economics was reciprocal. More efficient to share, than hoard. As they grew, accounting became necessary, so money originated as a voucher system.\n Yet we experience it as quantified hope, so desire to save it, which pulls it from circulation and the easiest solution is to add more vouchers\/money, but this represents unsupported promises of value and the system eventually collapses. So we \u201cinvest\u201d it in order to both save and keep it in circulation, but there is far more desire to save notational value, than bright ideas to effectively grow it, so we end up bidding against each other, creating asset inflation.\n The real elephant in the room is the degree to which government borrowing supports this supposedly \u201cfree market,\u201d by borrowing vast amounts of money, as the publicly secured debt that effectively serves as the medium of exchange in the financial markets.\n The essential conceptual fallacy is trying to store a medium. For example, in the body, blood is the medium and fat is the store. Or for cars, roads are the medium and parking lots are the store. Mix them up and the system ceases to function. We own money like we own the section of road we are on. Its functionality is in its fungibility.\n As it is, capitalism, \u201cthe markets,\u201d have metastasized from the efficient allocation of value, to the creation of notational value as an end in itself. We are destroying the resources of the planet to store the extracted abstraction of value.\n Just as a complete hypothetical, what if the government was to threaten to tax excess wealth and not just borrow it? Presumably people would quickly find other ways to store value. Given we all save for the same general reasons, from housing and raising children, to healthcare and retirement, what if we were to invest in these as community assets, rather then trying to save for them individually? we would go back to a reciprocal economy. One where we would be less atomized, as we would have to work together and not just sell our time, minds and bodies. We would be actively storing value in healthy societies and the environments they require, not just as digits in some bank\u2019s computers.\n While finance is a public utility, it is not government. Government, as the executive and regulatory function, equates to society\u2019s central nervous system, while finance, as the value circulation system, equates to the body\u2019s circulation system. They are separate and serve separate functions. When governments control the money supply, the impulse to inflate, when other promises can\u2019t be kept, is powerful for immediate benefits, while having the private sector in control amounts to parasitism. We need to further develop our social models to incorporate something beyond the binary.\n Wild ideas, but the current system looks fragile. JonW #3: Yeah, I thought about it.  You\u2019re right that most people today don\u2019t seem to be using \u201cincel\u201d to mean \u201cinvoluntary celibate\u201d (i.e., the literal meaning), but rather \u201cinvoluntary celibate who\u2019s also hateful.\u201d  Normally, my attitude is that I care about reality, not definitions, so I\u2019ll happily adopt whichever way of using words my interlocutor prefers.  In this case, however, the obvious problem is a euphemism treadmill (e.g., crippled \u2192 handicapped \u2192 disabled \u2192 differently abled, toilet \u2192 bathroom \u2192 restroom \u2192 facilities).  I.e., no matter which term we use for the romantically frustrated, the same forces that worked on the word \u201cincel\u201d will operate similarly: people will only pay attention when there\u2019s some terrible episode of violence, or toxic subcultures that celebrate it; ergo the new term will acquire the same radioactive connotations; ergo those who want to discuss the broader issue will need to find yet another term, and so on forever.  Or am I wrong? Incidentally, Ellen Pao could very easily have posted a followup tweet clarifying her meaning, but didn\u2019t.  I hope she\u2019ll take that opportunity now. Thank you for this powerfully moving while rationally written essay. And therein lies the [meta] problem: written by a nerd, for nerds, it\u2019s brilliant as usual, but will generally fail to connect with those who could gain the most from it. I\u2019ve known Robin online for a couple decades and consider him a friend and fellow traveler. His posts on the Extropy list, then on Overcoming Bias are always worth a read, but also extremely frustrating.  He, and a few other brilliant friends of mine, are characteristically _rational_ but often at the same time _unreasonable_. I\u2019m often reminded of one late-night session with a group of high-integrity futurists at a weekend retreat.  Everyone was smart, everyone was committed to helping make the world a better place\u2013and everyone was frustrated that they were making so little actual progress in the world around them. The conversation turned to what seemed a simple, well-defined question:  Should we strive for height, or breadth, in our efforts?  Is it better to achieve great heights, recognizable by only a few, or is it better to make a little progress, but with a broader impact? A nice, neatly stated, perfect sort of question, but one that misses the messy complexities of the context in which it must be executed.  Being on the nerd spectrum myself, I offered that perhaps the question is analogous to the problem of effective power transfer, requiring a form of multidimensional (in the social domain) complex conjugate impedance matching\u2014crickets. I tried again, suggesting that we should identify and exploit positive-sum opportunities while aiming always for increasing coherence over increasing context\u2014again, too weird even for my fellow weirdos. So your essay resonated strongly with me.  I\u2019m happily married and have children grown and on their own, but I struggle daily with emotional connection\u2013especially with those whom I care for the most. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen the George Bernard Shaw quote \u201cThe reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.\u201d I wish we could all celebrate the unreasonable among us, while appreciating our deep, hierarchical, fine-grained values-in-common. I think we are getting there, two steps forward, one step back.  Sad that it\u2019s such a struggle, when it\u2019s so obvious, so simple, so clear\u2026 I\u2019m in broad agreement with calls for charity and understanding, but I\u2019d also agree with DavidC that Pao is in danger of being misinterpreted here. I think turning the other cheek in this situation might be explaining why you would disagree strongly with the negative interpretation of her tweet, explain other interpretations that might be compatible with your values, and put it back to her or her supporters to clarify what they mean. To treat her the way you wish other people would treat Robin Hanson. A lesson I\u2019ve learned from watching these situations play out is how easy it is for people to both latch on to misunderstandings when they feel threatened, and fail at traversing the minefield of communicating to someone with a different perspective and set off their alarm bells for being threatened. It\u2019s a tremendously hard problem, but I think it starts with extending charity and forgiveness. I think that you\u2019re in denial about how offensive Hanson\u2019s post was:\nAs with income inequality, most folks concerned about sex inequality might explicitly reject violence as a method, at least for now, and yet still be encouraged privately when the possibility of violence helps move others to support their policies.\nHanson DOES seem to be encouraging or excusing violence in that paragraph.\nMoreover, this isn\u2019t the only time he\u2019s seemed to downplay rape. See his post comparing cuckoldry to a gentle, silent rape:\nhttp:\/\/www.overcomingbias.com\/2010\/11\/gentlesilentrape.html\nYour posts weren\u2019t encouraging violence- Hanson\u2019s were, as surely as, for example, George Ciccariello-Maher. Hanson went way over the line. @JonW#3- people aren\u2019t as binary as you\u2019re portraying. While I agree that people that IDENTIFY as incels and post about Chads and Stacys are horrible persons, a \u201cnormal\u201d celibate can blame women one day and himself the next, or feel it\u2019s women\u2019s fault in some ways and his in other ways, etc. A man can hold sexist beliefs and never hurt anyone and a man can hold egalitarian beliefs and kill someone or vice versa. The majority of people live in the grey, not in Black and White. [\u2026] Call him wrongheaded, na\u00efve, tone-deaf, insensitive, even an asshole, but don\u2019t ever accuse him of insincerity or hidden agendas. Robin also first articulated the concept of the Great Filter in the evolution of life in our universe. Earlier this year, Robin published a book together with Kevin Simler, entitled The Elephant In The Brain: Hidden Motives In Everyday Life. For the record: I think that Robin should never, ever have made this comparison, and I wish he\u2019d apologize for it now. And I advise any lonely young male nerd who might be readIng this blog to commit to the Zeroth Commandment as well, and to the precepts of feminism more broadly. Source: The Zeroth Commandment [\u2026] Jeff #16:  I too am married with adult children, and have struggled with connection with my family.  When I retired I decided that the way to improve my relationships with my children was to improve and understand myself better, and began meditating and studying Buddhist and Hindu theory of mind.  Several years down the road I find that these relationships have improved significantly, and that I am happier for it. I wonder if working on understanding ourselves may not be a better path to improving the world, rather than trying to achieve progress by changing others. Thanks for your thoughtful comments. Mark #17: As soon as Pao posts a clarification (and ideally, an apology to those who interpreted the word \u201cincel\u201d with its literal meaning), I\u2019ll be very happy to revise my post accordingly.  Is that reasonable? Scott#22: I think that\u2019s better than nothing, but I would still prefer pre-emptive charity. A number of people who misinterpret in these situations sincerely believe they\u2019re correct, I think it lowers the pressure to discuss the possible ideas in the abstract (I think Pao may sincerely be referring to extremists who feel entitled to sex), rather than making the conversation about a person and whether that person is good or evil. It may not always be necessary, but it seems like a policy that would prevent some of the more severe mischaracterizations. Scott, I\u2019m curious about one thing about your original discussion of \u201cshy male nerds\u201d. You seemed to think that your experience of being afraid of turning into a sexual predator was a uniquely male one. But in fact, teenagers with OCD often become afraid of becoming a sexual predator. It\u2019s not just boys- girls worry about becoming a pedophile or sexually harassing other girls, for example. This article describes the experience of one:\nhttps:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/health\/archive\/2013\/11\/obsessive-thoughts-a-darker-side-of-ocd\/281260\/\nSo do you really think your experience was any different than theirs? Like you they couldn\u2019t publicly admit what they were going to, and like you they felt they were alone and it was all their fault. If I may add a French perspective: on our side of the pond the subject of \u201cincels\u201d is not discussed, not even in hate messages, because it is not discussed, like, at all.\nThe media did point out that the Toronto van killer belonged to one of those uniquely North-American women-hating suprematist groups. Interestingly, if we move from the \u201creal world\u201d to the literary world, the situation is  different.\nIncels feature prominently in Michel Houellebecq\u2019s books, and in particular in his first novel \u201cextension du domaine de la lutte\u201d (title of the English translation: \u201cwhatever\u201d).\nIn case you wonder what the original title means: it refers to the extension of the \u201cdomain of struggle\u201d from money and power to romance and sex.\nHouellebecq is of course controversial, but he is widely recognized as one of the most interesting French writers in recent decades, and his books sell quite well.\nSo I conclude that in France this subject is ripe for discussion only in the world of fiction.\nAnyone cares to point out some relevant English language fiction? Yes, to answer the question you posed, it is obvious and I did think of it for myself, long ago. I also don\u2019t think whether rational people should be able to figure out a mutually accepted position on an objective matter is such a tough question either. (Not to say that everything that is obvious is easy to prove mathematically.) (On the objective question of who is smarter, me or you, the answer would be you; me or Hanson, I don\u2019t have enough data yet, but I\u2019m not impressed so far.) On why progressives aren\u2019t as convinced that sexual-gratification by second parties is as worthy of redistribution as wealth, that one also doesn\u2019t seem mystifying to me at all. In the case of sexual-satisfaction, there are substitutes for the physical sensations, which will be better in the future, and if you can\u2019t afford them, wealth distribution by itself would solve that problem, so it seems to me what the deprived are really asking for is some form of love: respect, admiration \u2013 the sort of emotional support one gets from a relationship. Well, that can\u2019t be redistributed because it can\u2019t be coerced; and if it could be coerced by some sort of brain-washing it would be more destructive of the benefactors than constructive for the receivers. Whereas if Gates had millions instead of billions he would be only marginally less well-off in practical terms, as he himself realizes. (And I myself, making about 100K$\/year in retirement, feel myself to be under-taxed, and try to donate at least as much as I spend.) If a  libertarian can\u2019t understand why a progressive would feel that way, that is the libertarian\u2019s problem. Actually, of course, their problem is that they can\u2019t understand why progressives believe in some form of wealth distribution; they should think harder about it, look at the data, and either come up with better arguments than the analogy to sexual redistribution or agree to agree with us. I\u2019m massively, furiously offended by one of your posts, requiring charitable amends!  I suggest it be in the form of an adoption fee at your nearest local greyhound adoption group. OK, not really, but I couldn\u2019t pass up the chance to flog my favorite charity.  If you really want to see universal love, adopt a greyhound; they\u2019re astounding sweet and loving, even compared to the usual sweetness of dogs. Michael #24: That\u2019s interesting; thanks.  On the one hand, I feel like there definitely is a problem here that\u2019s specific to (and common among) straight males\u2014especially those who are shy and nerdy, in STEM fields, on the autism spectrum, etc.\u2014one that\u2019s cohesive and distinctive enough that it\u2019s useful to resist assimilating it into anything else.  And what Loving describes, terrible in its way, sounds pretty different than what I went through (e.g., she had OCD fears about people who she wouldn\u2019t normally be sexually attracted to). On the other hand, yes, there\u2019s clearly an enormous rainbow of human misery that isn\u2019t taken seriously, that it\u2019s still OK for the \u201cenlightened\u201d to dismiss and ridicule, simply because it hasn\u2019t yet been recognized as real by the important authorities\u2014as homophobia and transphobia and fatphobia and slut-shaming finally were, after long and necessary fights.  One of the most moving experiences for me, in the wake of the comment-171 affair, was to get email after email from people who had more varied backgrounds than one might have predicted (African-Americans, Hispanics, gays, bi and lesbian women, straight women, trans women, \u2026), yet who told me that aspects of my story resonated with their own experience, and who therefore thanked me for opening up. Scott, the reason the term incel is popular across mainstream media is not because it refers to nerds like you and me; it refers to the denizens of reddit.com\/r\/incel and reddit.com\/r\/braincel. These are\/were two of the most popular communities for incels, and the content posted there is absolutely horrifying. Applaud for rape stories and daily denigrations of women are run-of-the-mill there. If the the two most popular communities for self-proclaimed incels are so horrifying, how do you think people are supposed to react? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing your arguments any favour or justice by associating yourself with such communities. Yes, toxic masculinity in society is a problem. It harms everyone involved. But supporting incels is like saying, \u201cI\u2019ll solve islamophobia by supporting ISIS\u201d: ineffective and horrifying. The Zeroeth Commandment seems far overly rigid. \u201cthey must never under any circumstances be touched without their consent\u201d What if a woman is intent on harming someone (possibly herself; possibly someone else), and the only way you can see to prevent it is by physically restraining her? Surely that is a circumstance in which it is justified to touch a woman without her consent. \u201cfoundation-stone of my moral worldview, the starting point of every action I take and every thought I think.\u201d Wait, what? I don\u2019t see how the principle of female bodily autonomy helps when thinking about trolley problems, deciding what to eat for lunch, or coming up with mathematical conjectures. It\u2019s important, but not that fundamental. The comparison between thinking you have a proof of P=NP and saying anything stronger than that suffering from deprivation of sex and romance is real and deserving of sympathy seems unfair to me. The latter claim has already been made and defended many times before; surely it should be acceptable to try to build on it at least a little bit. Robin didn\u2019t even go that much further; he didn\u2019t say much about what specific policies might be considered. (It might have helped him if he had, since it would be harder to just assume the worst) The claim that Arthur Chu wants you to kill yourself despite not having said so is a bold claim, and I\u2019m curious what evidence led you to believe it. There are I think some other aspects which are worth articulating about what is going on here. I\u2019m going for purposes of this comment distinguish between two groups: incel_1 and incel_2. Incel_1 are people who are simply put \u201cinvoluntarily celibate.\u201d Incel_2 is people in the self-identified incel community.   Scott is right when he says that for obvious reasons one isn\u2019t likely to get moderate people loudly identifying as incel, and Scott\u2019s reasoning applies to both definitions.  But there are other considerations. This seems closely connected to the famous essay about Keeping Your Identity Small http:\/\/www.paulgraham.com\/identity.html . In particular, once one identifies with a community and a label, one is going to think in terms of that label.  In particular, this has a definite context in terms of people who self-identify as Incel in the Incel_2 sense. First, if one is creating a part of one\u2019s own identity as not being successful in anything related to dating or the like, one isn\u2019t going to go through effort in this regard and moreover isn\u2019t going to succeed much.  Thinking that one isn\u2019t going to succeed at romantic or sexual matters is a pretty common teenage attitude (for almost all teenagers regardless of gender or orientation) and part of growing up is simply realizing that with a little effort things aren\u2019t bad. One can go to singles events and one can go on online dating websites, etc. But what is happening here in part if that people are falling into a community which doesn\u2019t encourage people to do anything like that, but rather encourages them to keep reinforcing their own hangups. Honestly, if one wants to remove the Incel community as a community, probably the most effective thing to do would be simply to get non-Incels to find volunteer to help people in Incel_2 write half-way decent OKCupid profiles.  The second issue is that the Incel community in the sense of Incel_2 really is incredibly toxic. While I agree with Scott\u2019s basic analogy involving Islam and Islamic extremists in the Incel_1 context, it is worth pointing out how really bad the Incel_2 community is. One could for example, compare on Reddit \/r\/Islam with \/r\/incels although with \/r\/incels now banned one would need to look at \/r\/braincels which is almost as bad as the original. And since the original incel subreddit got banned, \/r\/braincels is trying to stay more lowkey to avoid another banning, but a glance at recently upvoted threads shows how toxic the community is https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Braincels\/comments\/8hesop\/based_sciencecel\/ and https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Braincels\/comments\/8hf422\/there_is_an_irreconcilable_conflict_between\/ are both examples. And these really are representative of the community not just idle discussion threads, in so far as they are reflected in the upvotes. I\u2019d invite you to go to \/r\/Islam and try to put up an anti-Christian or anti-Jewish post and see how long it lasts.  Finally, the Incel community, as a community, is to put it mildly, sex-obsessed. These aren\u2019t people who are upset about their lack of romantic interactions, they are to a large extent people who are unhappy that they aren\u2019t getting sex, period. I suspect that Incel_1 isn\u2019t that way to the same extent (and in a similar way am pretty confident that young Scott wasn\u2019t as sex-centric as these people are).  It is also worth noting in this context, that unlike people who might be Incel_1, the Incel_2 community at a fundamental level doesn\u2019t have respect for women. And more to the point, they don\u2019t get that respecting other human beings as human beings isn\u2019t just a moral issue but is pragmatically useful. So, Scott\u2019s basic approach seems correct for Incel_1, but Incel_2 seems like a very different situation. It is also worth noting that to some extent what one is seeing here is a standard failure mode of communities where insular communities reinforce their own ideas and form echo chambers. In this case, the situation is pretty similar to that, but it is a community formed by people who are already having trouble. It is as if one had a cannot-do-math community that banned all mathematicians or people otherwise good at math, and then refused to listen to them, and started reaching their own conclusions about how math actually worked or what would be good math pedagogy. It would go down-hill really fast.  To some extent then, part of what we should be asking, is \u201cHow do we prevent people in their late teens or early 20s who might be at risk of joining Incel_2, not do so?\u201d I mentioned OKCupid profiles before, but what can we do at a more systematic level? I think one of the things that is worth realizing is that we do have a genuinely toxic masculinity in our culture where men may be taught to care about sex, and to downplay romantic considerations. Removing those aspects of society would go a long way. At the same time, it is possible that that\u2019s not all that is going on there; it is possible that some people genuinely have an underlying biology that cares a lot about sex; if there can be people who have all sorts of fetishes or people who are asexual or people who have sexual interests in furries, I don\u2019t see why there can\u2019t be people who are really by their own biology just as obsessed with sex. And in that regard, legalized prostitution is probably a reasonable step; of course, this doesn\u2019t mean that prostitutes will be forced as part of their jobs to have sex; and yes, some of the people will still not end up getting sex because most prostitutes quite reasonably don\u2019t want to have sex with people who give off incredibly creepy or dangerous vibes.  But that will help somewhat. Thanks Scott for your courage with this message of compassion. I have zero vested interest\/relevance in this specific topic, but I just wish to applaud anyone who will put themselves in the line of fire to uplift basic human decency and goodwill.  I hope you get some of that goodwill in return; at least, please know that some people understand. Re the climate chance discounting thing: Even if you apply exponential discounting, any sort of calculation of potential future harms of climate change that can include mass extinction jumps the social cost of carbon up (I saw a paper that claimed around 130$, but I can\u2019t find it atm). For comparison, the current cost of preventing a ton of carbon is 1-3$. A world where we actually applied normal exponential discounting of potential future harms of climate change and acted accordingly would look very different from our own, maybe even to the point where it looked like we were doing enough about it. About your zeroth commandment\u2026 When you talk about Muslim or Marxist terrorists, you condemn them, but you don\u2019t talk about them like Fox News does, you don\u2019t go on a rant about savages destroying our values or whatever. So it bothers me that when talking about the incels you do condemn, you talk about them the exact same way any SJW extremist would.\nSo I don\u2019t think I can really agree with your zeroth commandment, in the same way I wouldn\u2019t agree with Fox on terrorism despite opposing terrorism.  I have cause to condemn a lot of this stuff, but it\u2019s from different reasoning and would use different wording. When I decide someone\u2019s actually too far in that direction for me, I\u2019ll do it through my own algorithms, not by deciding feminist algorithms are correct in this instance, because I already know those algorithms are broken. Joshua #31: Thanks for the insightful remarks! I confess that I\u2019ve found the interminable online argument about whether incels \u201creally\u201d want sex, or whether they just say they want sex but really want affection, validation, etc., to be missing the point. My theory holds that, for straight men (incel or non-incel), these things are one package that you can\u2019t really disentangle.  I.e.: straight men want sex partly because of the validation of their human worth that they feel will come from knowing that a woman actually likes them enough to want that.  And conversely, they want the validation and acceptance partly because that, more than any mere physiological sensation, is what will make the sex itself satisfying. Or at least, my theory holds that the above describes one type of straight men.  There\u2019s also a second type in my theory, for whom sex has nothing whatsoever to do with self-worth, and is just an optional add-on to a romantic relationship, or a fun way to pass the time (like miniature golf) that they keep finding themselves doing for some reason.  This second type is known in my theory as \u201cliars.\u201d \ud83d\ude00 Echoing the other comments saying that \u201cincel\u201d is not merely a term for a lonely virgin. It\u2019s a particular subculture with particularly heinous beliefs. Of course lonely virgins are deserving of compassion. But uncritically taking the term \u201cincel\u201d at face value doesn\u2019t help anyone but them. Conflating the two just legitimizes the idea that their repugnant views deserve any consideration. > I hold the bodily autonomy of women\u2014the principle that women are freely-willed agents rather than the chattel they were treated as for too much of human history; that they, not their fathers or husbands or anyone else, are the sole rulers of their bodies; and that they must never under any circumstances be touched without their consent\u2014to be my Zeroth Commandment, the foundation-stone of my moral worldview, the starting point of every action I take and every thought I think.  This principle of female bodily autonomy, for me, deserves to be chiseled onto tablets of sapphire, placed in a golden ark adorned with winged cherubim sitting atop a pedestal inside the Holy of Holies in a temple on Mount Moriah. > This, or something close to it, is really what I believe. Incredible that the *foundation of all your morality*, the indivisible seed from which all action should flow and to which all moral precepts are a corollary, includes concepts as complex and specific as \u201cbodily autonomy\u201d and \u201cwomen\u201d, and doesn\u2019t explicitly mention anything like, say, \u201csuffering\u201d or \u201charm\u201d. Do you think women are ontologically fundamental? Or is this supposed to be read as Straussian, and you\u2019re making fun of the spineless hordes of Online Women Respecters who fall over themselves to proclaim their wokeness as hard as they possibly can because they think it\u2019ll protect them? Brilliant, if so. Thank you Scott. I think that what the original blog \u201cTwo Types of Envy\u201d and this entry highlight is the difference between two mindsets: 1- The \u201centitlement mindset\u201d, which is the belief that society owes individuals \u201cstuff\u201d for the mere fact of being alive.  2- The \u201cgenerosity mindset\u201d, which is the belief that individuals have a moral obligation of sharing their success with the less fortunate. 1- is very popular in European countries since at least the times of Middle Ages feudalism where the social contract was that vassals agreed to submit to the feudal lord in exchange of the feudal lord guaranteeing their physical safety. Overtime, the feudal lord was replaced by an almighty government that provides for \u201cwelfare\u201d -which in the age of no wars among major powers following WWII\u2019s usage of nuclear weapons- is the average European Joe\u2019s biggest concern. Among those who push for the \u201centitlement\u201d mindset as being good, it is fair to raise the question where is the limit of the things that \u201centitlement minded governments\u201d  have to provide. Obviously I agree 100% with Scott that forcing women into sex with males who cannot find a sexual partner is 100% off limits. However, would it be OK for these \u201centitlement minded governments\u201d to pay for prostitutes that would help the aforementioned males meet their needs? I don\u2019t think one can say that socialized medicine is good but socialized sex would be bad provided the appropriate compensation is there as it happens with doctors, all of whom are compensated for their work as part of the socialized medicine system. I also think that the genius of the American Revolution was to understand that 1- doesn\u2019t produce good results for anybody involved in the long run and that 2- is the best course of action, limiting the action of government to the provision of national security and administration of justice. To summarize, no, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with raising the possibility of government sponsored \u201csex\u201d in those countries where the overwhelming majority of the population believes to be entitled to \u201cstuff\u201d. There\u2019s an interesting parallel here to the backlash that Peter Singer has faced over the years. First, for his advocacy against animal suffering. People have mocked him again and again and again. But few have bothered to actually defuse his arguments and tell us why the incalculable animal suffering in factory farms isn\u2019t worthy of moral consideration. Second, he suffered an even more vicious backlash for suggesting that euthanasia of highly disabled infants is permissible. Again, lots of vitriol but no counterargument telling us why the immense suffering the child and parents doesn\u2019t matter; or, why if abortion is permissible, euthanasia of the baby isn\u2019t.  Thankfully, Singer put forth most of his controversial views before the era of the Twitter mob. I\u2019m certain if he\u2019d come up with his insights during the Twitter era, he\u2019d mocked so brutally that his views would probably have been deemed radioactive and unworthy of consideration. By the way, your description of the emotional reaction one has when reading Robin Hanson is spot on. I remember coming across his blog about 7-8 years ago. I read something he\u2019d written about how academia is all about signalling. As someone just starting out in research, I felt hurt and angry, and thought \u201cWho does this guy think he is? How the hell does he have a job? God, I can\u2019t stand his smugness.\u201d I started writing a comment, thinking, \u201cI\u2019m going to put this idiot in his place and tear down his silly argument.\u201d But then I became slowly aware that it was not at all obvious that what he was saying was wrong.  And as I went through many of his other blog posts, that\u2019s when I slowly realized that I was in the presence of genius. The end of this post was beautiful. I often feel awful when the culture war touches on the legitimacy of my identity or feelings. I hope that I\u2019ll be able to remember your reframing in the future. And I thought I had read Huckleberry Finn before, but maybe it was only an abridged version, because I hadn\u2019t read that chapter. The way Twain exploited Finn\u2019s bad grammar to suggest double meanings in what was really good or bad was very interesting, thanks for the link. The other James is not me, though I do agree with his sentiment that Scott\u2019s over-the-top social signalling, while understandable, is disheartening. It emboldens the very reactionaries Scott would admonish. (I guess if one doesn\u2019t first issue such a mission statement, people will feel justified to dismiss the content on its face.  So such assertions have their value reduced, leading to an arms race of signalling, which ultimately encourages tribalism.) Isn\u2019t wealth vs sexual inequality an essentially quantitative issue?  The answer is obviously yes; if only the \u201ctop\u201d 1% of men were able to procreate, it would call for some kind of societal restructuring.  This isn\u2019t even particularly revolutionary; look, for instance, at Japan\u2019s aging populations and the government\u2019s programs to incentivize dating and procreation.  (I realize the \u201cprocreate\u201d is not synonymous with sexual satisfaction, and I apologize for phrasing the argument in heteronormative terms.) In general, we value things like personal freedom, autonomy, and ownership of one\u2019s \u201cstuff\u201d (whether it be one\u2019s self or one\u2019s money).  The issue with wealth inequality (I thought) is about (i) perversion of the system:  wealth yields political influence, and (ii) the huge discrepancy of the marginal value of a dollar once the welcome gap becomes large enough (leading to an inefficient allocation of resources).  In the latter case, we are talking about factors like 10^6, while it is physically impossible for such factors to arise in the setting of sexual inequality.  (Insert Wilt Chamberlain joke here\u2026) Oh, while I\u2019m here, acknowledging the importance of women\u2019s rights, I feel like we should reserve our Zeroth commandment for something more foundational, like \u201cassertions require justifications\u201d or \u201cmoral precepts must be consistent with each other\u201d. Or, if you want to take a more empathy grounded and less reason grounded approach to metaethics \u201cwhen you feel the pain of others, care about it\u201d. I see no reason that women are more entitled to the coveted slot of the Zeroth commandment than any other group of beings. Much to discuss here, but a little thing that caught my eye is the word \u201ceven\u201d in the phrase \u201ccompassion even for the pedophile\u2026\u201d The pedophile you go on to describe is a wholly good person. What ELSE could you possibly feel for someone like him (other than perhaps admiration for having the strength of character to flight the urges he didn\u2019t choose to be saddled with)? Why the \u201ceven\u201d??  It seems like a really odd concession to societal prejudice that smacks heavily of irony in a post attempting to point out irrationality and unfairness of societal prejudice. required #35 and others: In the entire comment-171 affair, I don\u2019t think I ever once used the word \u201cincel.\u201d  Nor, of course, did I come within a light-year of the attitudes that people have rightly flagged here as putting the online \u201cincel community\u201d beyond the pale of civilized humanity, such as wishing or celebrating violence, or vilifying women.  On the contrary, I repeatedly affirmed my strong feminist beliefs, and urged any shy male nerds reading my blog to do the same. Yet despite that, all across social media, people insisted on applying the 5-letter word to me, or at least to my previous self.  Why? If I had to guess, I think it\u2019s because I refused to endorse the one socially approved explanation for what so many shy male nerds go through: namely, that it\u2019s all down to their own terrible behavior and attitudes.  On this theory, if swaggering, non-nerdy guys enjoy more romantic success, it must be because they\u2019re more deeply moral than nerds are, more sensitive and feminist, better able to see women as people.  And hence, if the nerds would only look further inward, blame themselves even more, repent even harder for their failings, maybe their problems would sort themselves out. I did not endorse that theory, and will never endorse it. But that doesn\u2019t mean I ever blamed women: on the contrary!  In the comment that changed my life, one of the central messages I tried to get across was that women as a class are not to blame: that they, like guys, are just trying to play the cards they\u2019re dealt as best they can. Some would ask: if it\u2019s not women\u2019s fault, and it\u2019s not the male nerds\u2019 fault either, then whose fault is it?  Fate?  An indifferent cosmos?  Natural selection?  Inadequate equilibria?  Changes in social norms beyond any individual\u2019s control?  Childhood bullies?  Ax-grinding ideologues who eagerly reinforce nerds\u2019 fear of the world, and the world\u2019s fear of nerds?  Or more broadly: why, a priori, should we have born into a universe where the wicked so often prosper while the righteous suffer? As you might know, this is a class of question that my people has been asking for quite some time. \ud83d\ude42  We even put a whole book about it into the bible\u2014though admittedly, not one that ever really coughs up a satisfactory answer. My point is: we need to preserve some linguistic space for the many nerdy guys who are utterly repulsed by violence, misogyny, and anyone who\u2019d even think about supporting them\u2014but who are also unwilling to affirm the self-abnegating falsehood that the mainstream currently demands as its precondition for not being lumped in with violent misogynists.  For the Jobs, the questioners, the ones with their fingers pointed neither at themselves nor at \u201cChad\u201d and \u201cStacy,\u201d but (if anywhere) at human nature itself and the moral foundations of the world.  What word would you recommend for them? chephy #44: The word \u201ceven\u201d is there solely because of how radioactively unpopular it is to use a word like \u201ccompassion\u201d anywhere in the same galaxy as the word \u201cpedophile\u201d\u2014not because I think the pedophile in my example did anything wrong. Scott #45, \u201cMy point is: we need to preserve some linguistic space for the many nerdy guys who are utterly repulsed by violence, misogyny, and anyone who\u2019d even think about supporting them\u2014but who are also unwilling to affirm the self-abnegating falsehood that the mainstream currently demands as its precondition for not being lumped in with violent misogynists. \u201d Amen brother! I go back to the discussion of the American obsession with \u201cseeking consensus\u201d subjugating individuality. Albert Einstein is said to have said, \u201cgreat spirits have always encountered opposition from mediocre minds. The mediocre mind is incapable of understanding the man who refuses to bow blindly to conventional prejudices and chooses instead to express his opinions courageously and honestly.\u201d  I wouldn\u2019t say that every great spirit is a nerdy male like the ones you describe above, but certainly they are subjugated by the mainstream the way Einstein describes above mediocre minds subjugate great spirits.  \u201cFor the Jobs, the questioners, the ones with their fingers pointed neither at themselves nor at \u201cChad\u201d and \u201cStacy,\u201d but (if anywhere) at human nature itself and the moral foundations of the world. What word would you recommend for them?\u201d I am reluctant to use a label to describe a set of people who might be very heterogeneous otherwise. In fact, I am in generally against labels for this very same reason: they are limiting even when they convey accurately a certain aspect of a person\u2019s personality or worldview. We just need to acknowledge that while it is possible to appeal to a universal sense of humanity that all humans share, humans also can be very different and have very different internal clocks not only when it comes to sex but also to other things. As a geek working in high tech at a place where the overwhelming majority of my colleagues are hard left, being a geek and not being hard left is very hard. The last thing I would do to these males is to come up with some sort of label that is then limiting to them in many other ways. Scott #46 Yes, I get it that \u201ceven\u201d here refers to the willingness to show compassion when it\u2019s consistent with moral code regardless of how controversial society at large considers it. It\u2019s kind of ironic still, considering that the pedophile in the above example is probably most deserving of compassion of all examples given due to his having done nothing wrong or illegal (unlike an undocumented immigrant) AND his not having any means of correcting the issue (unlike an overweight woman or a socially inept man). Just underscores the unfairness (though not necessarily irrationally) of some prejudices). However, I may be more naive than you are but I don\u2019t think anyone short of some kind of a fascist would not feel compassion for the pedophile in question. The societal contempt of paedophiles is generally directed at those who actually attempt to engage in some sort of sexual act with children, or procure child pornography, or advocate for sexual access to children. Not at those who are cursed with sexual attraction to kids but would never dream of acting on it. Again, maybe I\u2019m naive. Scott, I appreciate your honesty in defending Robin Hanson, and in writing things like \u201cFor if we did, then consistency might eventually force us to show compassion to white male nerds as well.\u201d  A good and very thoughtful post. But have you thought through the civilizational survival implications of your Zeroth Commandment of the bodily autonomy of women?  Have you thought about why there are so few historical examples of such autonomy until recently?  Marital rape is still a radical new concept that\u2019s existed for only a sliver of history (and won\u2019t last long because the survival value of thinking that way is so negative).  Have you thought about why female emancipation is historically seen primarily in empires in their late decline stage, or in tribal matriarchies that never develop a civilization in the first place?  I hold that your Zeroth Law is a death sentence for a high civilization, rendering it incapable of competing with other civilizations.  I hold that Western Civilization is well into its decline stage, and part of the cause is that women have been freed to make profoundly bad mating choices. Compare the fertility rates of slut-walking Westerners with the fertility rates of societies that severely restrict their women\u2019s behavior and arrange their marriages.  As your readers well know, in the fullness of time, exponential growth beats exponential shrinkage pretty soundly.  Europe will probably be a Muslim continent in a century; if so, you can kiss the Zeroth Commandment goodbye there forever. But fertility isn\u2019t my main argument.  My main argument is that high civilization can only be built and maintained where most of the men have families they are deeply invested in maintaining, and those families provide a basic level of respect to the men (including family authority and wifely sex and fidelity).  That\u2019s an important part of why the West is losing all its vitality while the East is rising.  Western civilization has recently chosen to destroy the social institutions and sexual morals that give men a return on their investment.  Thus we can no longer maintain a high civilization.  But we\u2019re running on momentum so a lot of people still haven\u2019t noticed the collapse that\u2019s coming soon.  No high civilization can stay high without controlling its women\u2019s sexual morality. I would love to see a mathematical model of competing civilizations where some give women total liberty to choose their sex partners and others restrain that liberty.  (Did Hanson address this?)  But as you say, it\u2019s an absolute taboo today to suggest that a society has any interest in saying how women distribute sex.  (A taboo in the West, not a taboo in the civilizations that will soon beat our asses.)  Women have such a strong emotional revulsion to the thought of sex with the wrong guy (most guys) that they can\u2019t logically consider the societal ramifications at all.  Thus most people who live through the collapse will be totally uncomprehending of one of its main causes. Back to my main point:  don\u2019t give your Zeroth Commandment too much credence until we\u2019ve had a century to see how it plays out.  Communism too seemed like a great idea until the experiments had been running for a while. elephants #43 and others: Placing the bodily autonomy of women as my Zeroth Commandment, ahead of \u201cno murdering\u201d and everything else, could just be chalked up to literary flourish\u2014or to my recently spending a day in the Old City of Jerusalem, and getting the image in my head of modern feminist principles inscribed on the tablets in the Ark of the Covenant. But actually, for the young, shy, nerdy guys of the modern world who I\u2019m trying to reach, I claim that my choice of Zeroth Commandment has a certain logic to it. If you\u2019re such a guy, then you don\u2019t much need commandments telling you not to lie or steal or murder (let alone worship graven images or covet your neighbor\u2019s ox \ud83d\ude42 ), because you feel so little temptation in those directions. But walking outside every day, seeing so many cheerful, laughing, achingly beautiful women who you can\u2019t kiss, can\u2019t touch, and probably shouldn\u2019t even approach (even though other men can, and do, using social skills about as accessible to you as Galois theory is to a baboon)?  And then back to your dorm room, or your office, to your ascetic programming or theorem-proving life, and not letting it warp your character\u2014rejecting every whispered invitation of bitterness and hate\u2014so that you can look yourself in the mirror and say, \u201cyes, I\u2019m still the kind and decent person who I wanted to grow up into when I was a boy\u201d?  Now that strikes me as a genuine spiritual battle between your higher self and your lower one\u2014and moreover, a battle that your higher self needs to win every single time without exception.  This, it seems to me, is precisely the sort of situation that the prophets of old would have recognized as requiring a Commandment. This was a beautiful post, Scott. Thank you. Scott, others have already commented at the oddness of your zeroth commandment, so I\u2019ll not add to that beyond saying that as stated I do not find it particularly resonating and to some extent even ridiculous, not in its goals but in its selectiveness and prioritization. Instead I want to comment on this part: > we\u2019re horrendously deficient in empathy and compassion, constantly wanting to reduce human emotions to numbers in spreadsheets or something.  As I\u2019ve remarked elsewhere, I\u2019ve scarcely encountered any stereotype that rings falser to my experience. I see myself as someone who fits this stereotype fairly well. Daily in social interactions I have to play little mental games tallying the pleasantries-exchanged balance, feign condolences when something negative happened to co-workers, rope others into my toe-stepping so they deliver the message in a less blunt manner and outright lie about social activities. Similarly I have learned when to simply shut up and stand aside while others wrangle people issues. It took me many years to even realize that I was emotionally hurting my mother by what seemed perfectly reasonable behavior to me. Whenever we talk to each other there is a non-negligible risk that her feelings end up hurt and I annoyed at her inability to listen. The only solution I have found is to severely restrict the frequency and scope of things we talk about. Anyway, what I want to say is that nerds with little to no empathy exist. Maybe you\u2019re more likely to find them unfiltered on 4chan and reddit while in real life they might know well enough to simply keep to themselves. Anon #7 \u2013 Assuming for a moment that the way you interpreted #1\u2019s post is correct then I would suggest you consider whether your response would actually score any points with #1 if he had psychopathic traits. If you accuse someone of \u201cmerely\u201d treating human interactions as exercises in game theory then think what you would do if this is the best you could hope for and try to present arguments that could tip the other party\u2019s evaluation of the tradeoff matrix towards an outcome you consider more palatable. Scott #50: Ok, but now it comes off like you\u2019re telling me to define my life around one problem that I\u2019m disproportionately likely to have. I actually have greater ambitions than merely not harming anyone in a certain way that I might be assumed to constantly be tempted to do. Scott #35: LOL \ud83d\ude42 Throw rocks at inpovs when they blame rich people for their involuntary poverty. Hey there, just a small point to make. I am a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist, and you are correct in a very limited sense that we are \u201cextreme\u201d. However, we are only extreme from the standpoint of the average irrational person. We wish to re-organize society on a rational basis \u2013 where all means of production are seized by the proletariat and used to their full potential. This is not extreme in the slightest, and those who wish to deny our aims through violence (the capitalist imperialists and comprador bourgeoisie) are actually the ones who are extreme I think. I think your blog misrepresents us as \u201cextreme\u201d, although I understand that there\u2019s a lot of capitalist propaganda out there which could easily make people biased and repeat how we\u2019re supposedly extreme without really giving it a second though. I would love to have a respectful dialogue with you on this point because mainstream media and twitter pundits try to shut out a calm, level-headed and kind discussion of the benefits of communism. I wish you wouldn\u2019t talk about \u201cincels\u201d like they\u2019re analogous to all Muslims.  Incels refers to small radical online communities that have repeatedly produced murderous terrorists and are centered around violent rhetoric that encourages these terrorists.  I don\u2019t think analogies are typically helpful in this kind of discussion, but if you want an analogy Incels are analogous Al-Qaeda or ISIS which are also groups that radicalize angry young men online and encourage them to run vans over people.  If you want to refer to a larger more moderate group choose a word to refer to the group you want to refer to, like nerds or lonely young men, and not a word that radical online groups that recruit and encourage terrorism have chosen to refer to themselves. I\u2019d also encourage you to think a little bit about why you keep adding \u201cWhite and Asian\u201d to nerds in this post.  Are you saying Black and Hispanic nerds don\u2019t exist?  Or that they don\u2019t have similar struggles with loneliness and fitting in and finding partners?  You\u2019re veering pretty close to some very ugly stereotypes around Black men here, and it isn\u2019t helping your argument to explicitly exclude Black and Hispanic nerds.  (Of course, there are some specific harmful stereotypes about Asian men that I\u2019m not trying to deny or minimize.) Scott #50 If I were a nerdy and very lonely guy, which I guess I am, I\u2019d see someone telling me that Respecting Women\u2019s Bodily Autonomy should be my fundamental moral axiom \u2014 lest I become the media\u2019s caricature of an incel \u2014 as incredibly patronizing. It also probably wouldn\u2019t benefit me much even if I went along with it, since I\u2019d almost definitely already be someone who errs on the side of Respecting Women by never going out of my way to interact with them anyway, and cementing it as the most important thing I can ever do would probably just ensure I\u2019d stay lonely until I die. #15: It\u2019s pretty strange to on the one hand say you\u2019re using \u201cincel\u201d in a literal sense rather than the sense it\u2019s actually used, but you\u2019re still only using it to refer to men and boys, who are not by most studies the majority, let alone the only people, suffering from romantic and sexual isolation. I said in a previous post, \u201cI don\u2019t think one can say that socialized medicine is good but socialized sex would be bad provided the appropriate compensation is there as it happens with doctors, all of whom are compensated for their work as part of the socialized medicine system.\u201d Doing additional research, it turns out that something of this sort is already happening in the Netherlands,  https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/health\/7945785\/Councils-pay-for-prostitutes-for-the-disabled.html One issue that I wish Scott brought up is that equating being \u201cnot in a relationship\u201d with being a loser, or (even worse) with being mentally ill or evil or dangerous, is practically an invitation to abuse. I\u2019ve known multiple people, of both genders, who stayed in awful, toxic relationships for years largely because society expected them to \u201cbe with someone\u201d. I think it\u2019s far better, in the long run, to be \u201calone\u201d than to be stuck with someone who has zero respect for you, manipulates you, isolates you, or ruins your life. But as Tim Urban said, \u201cIn our world, the major rule is to get married before you\u2019re too old\u2014and \u201ctoo old\u201d varies from 25 \u2013 35, depending on where you live. The rule should be \u201cwhatever you do, don\u2019t marry the wrong person,\u201d but society frowns much more upon a 37-year-old single person than it does an unhappily married 37-year-old with two children. It makes no sense\u2014the former is one step away from a happy marriage, while the latter must either settle for permanent unhappiness or endure a messy divorce just to catch up to where the single person is.\u201d Noah Snyder: My answer to pretty much every point you raise is that the specific groups I talked about, and the words I used to refer to them, were determined by the attacks that I see on social media. Of course black and Hispanic men also suffer these problems.  As I mentioned above, some of them emailed me in the wake of the comment-171 affair, and I tried my best to give them advice and support, as I did with everyone who wrote to me. In comment 171, I said nothing whatsoever about race, and neither did Robin in any of his comments: it simply had nothing to do with what either of us was talking about.  And yet, in the attacks on both of us, again and again you see formulations like \u201call these whiny privileged white dudes in tech should [shut up | fuck themselves | jump off a bridge].\u201d By my count, I mentioned \u201cwhite\u201d a total of 3 times in the current post (not counting \u201cwhite-hot rage\u201d)\u2014and every single time, it was in the context of paraphrasing those sorts of attacks. (Incidentally, I\u2019m giving the attackers the benefit of the doubt that they know that a large percentage of the nerdy male tech workers about whom they\u2019re trying to express their contempt are actually Jews or East Asians, but they don\u2019t care, because Jews and East Asians don\u2019t rate on their hierarchy of oppression for most purposes.) And it\u2019s the same with \u201cincel\u201d: at the end of the day, I used the word only because the attackers so liberally use it, even against men who share none of the violent misogynistic tendencies of the online \u201cincel community.\u201d  (And even then, I surrounded the word with scare quotes throughout the post.) And yes, if \u201cincel\u201d retains its literal meaning of \u201cinvoluntary celibate,\u201d then there are certainly straight female \u201cincels\u201d as well (and gay and lesbian \u201cincels\u201d too, which is yet another discussion).  I\u2019ve met straight female \u201cincels,\u201d I heard from a decent number in the wake of comment 171, and I feel strongly that society should do whatever it can to offer them sympathy and support.  The possibility of matchmaking between them and male \u201cincels\u201d is almost too obvious to mention.  And if ever female \u201cincels\u201d are attacked by mainstream commentators, like their male counterparts regularly are, as entitled losers and creeps whose so-called suffering doesn\u2019t matter and who should just get themselves out of the gene pool, then I believe with every bone in my body that decent people everywhere should rise to their defense. A bit on the tangent: isn\u2019t there a straightforward way to get out of Aumann\u2019s theorem (while maintaining rationality) is to claim that we have different priors? I\u2019m aware that there are some arguments saying that we all should have the same priors but none of them have the status of a theorem. \u201cCompassion even for the pedophile who\u2019d sooner kill himself than hurt a child, but who\u2019s been given no support for curing or managing his condition.\u201d Writing this took courage. I also thought of it but would have never written or uttered it. Bravo, Scott! Anon #49: It horrifies me to know that people with the power of a professor walk around on the same campus as me while harbouring such awful views about female autonomy.  I can only pray that you don\u2019t have any female students, lest their career is ruined by you. Two points I would like to make on this:\n1) the argument about whether the term incel refers to all involuntary celibate men, or just a hard core of hateful misogynistic internet posters is as blatant a motte and bailey as i\u2019ve ever seen. Posters will say \u201ccut it off if it hasn\u2019t been used in so long\u201d. And will then retreat to \u201cI just meant the misogynistic mass murder advocates\u201d if they are challenged. But if they aren\u2019t challenged the meaning clearly stays as \u201call lonely men\u201d \u2013 lonely men who would be in no doubt the comment was addressed to them.\n2) I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a lack of moderate advocates willing to come forward that is the problem. Two reasons: 1)In other areas that might be characterised as men\u2019s rights issues the existence of more moderate spokespeople hasn\u2019t helped at all. 2) individuals such as yourself, Scott Alexander, Robin Hanson ARE the more moderate voices. And you still get all this blowback. As will any other \u201cmoderate\u201d incel or incel-sympathiser. Murmur #63: Right, Aumann\u2019s theorem assumes (and indeed, provided the occasion to introduce) the so-called Common Prior Assumption, or CPA.  The whole point of the business with indexicals is to justify the CPA, by showing how even if you thought you and your friend had differing priors, actually \u201cbeing born as you\u201d and \u201cbeing born as your friend\u201d are just yet more events to conditionalize on\u2014starting from behind some Veil of Ignorance where the two priors would necessarily be the same, because there wouldn\u2019t yet be anything to differentiate them. You\u2019re right that this is a philosophical argument, not a theorem\u2014so if you don\u2019t buy it, we can just \u201cagree to disagree.\u201d \ud83d\ude00 This is an awesome post, Scott. Heartfelt, compassionate, and clear. Twitter will never be satisfied, though, no matter what you say. :-\/ MarxBro #56: Even though your ideology led to the deaths of 100 million people in the last century, I predict that you might have more success winning mainstream support for it nowadays than for the ideology that says that socially awkward male tech workers bleed when you prick them. \ud83d\ude09 \u201cIndeed, let me go further: if you were ever hurt or offended by anything I said, and if I can make partial restitution to you by taking some time to field your questions about quantum computing and information, or math, CS, and physics more generally, or academic career advice, or anything else where I\u2019m said to know something, please shoot me an email.  I\u2019m also open to donating to your favorite charity.\u201d Ah, shit, dude, you\u2019re warming my heart, here.  You\u2019re implicitly acknowledging that the same women who feel threatened by the idea of \u201csex redistribution\u201d can also be folks who care about math and CS and physics, right? I appreciate that. What with this and the whole Zeroth Commandment thing, I did want to say, don\u2019t think it doesn\u2019t make a difference when you say stuff like this. And let me say, too, that I wholeheartedly sign on to your project of universal compassion as a basis for rationalism. Some of the hardest \u2014 and hardest-hitting \u2014 critiques of feminism that I\u2019ve ever read have come from people like Scott Alexander who succeed, sometimes, in showing that we\u2019ve failed to live up to the empathy that we so often advocate. One of the hardest things about the debates that arose from Hanson\u2019s initial post, for me, was seeing so many people react to it by defending Hanson\u2019s lack of compassion for anyone who reacted to the implicit physical threat even as they tried to use Hanson\u2019s post to advocate for more compassion for men who find relationships hard. I really appreciate how thoroughly this post avoids that problem. Thank you. GemmaM #70: Thanks! So, uh, you have a question?  (Fine if you don\u2019t.) \ud83d\ude42 \u201cAccording to my complexity-theoretic refinement of Aumann\u2019s agreement theorem, which I later published in STOC\u20192005, two Bayesian agents with a common prior can ensure that they agree to within \u00b1\u03b5 about the value of a [0,1]-valued random variable, with probability at least 1-\u03b4 over their shared prior, by exchanging only O(1\/(\u03b4\u03b5^2)) bits of information\u2014completely independent of how much knowledge the agents have.  My conclusion was that, if Aumann\u2019s Nobel-prizewinning theorem fails to demonstrate the irrationality of real-life disagreements, then it\u2019s not for reasons of computational or communication efficiency\u201d But due to the non-tightness of the result, does this really support your conclusion in any practical sense? E.g., say we want \u03b5=2^-40 and \u03b4=0.01, then the result states that we need to exchange no more than around ~87 bits of information. But that\u2019s not really a small communication cost if you ask me! Thus, doesn\u2019t your original object to Hanson and Cowen\u2014that reaching agreement might require a massive communication cost\u2014in some sense still hold up? I want to nth the critique the, for many (if not most) people incel means \u201cself identified incel, i.e somebody who goes on incel reddits\/chans. That people use it to attack people who are not a member of this subculture is not surprising and doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t view the word as attacking this subculture. (People call people there insulting nazis and white nationalist too, self identifying as a white nationalist, on the basis of being patriotic and white is clearly a horrible idea) I definitely winced at Ellen Pao\u2019s tweet but, charitably, it was probably aimed as the subculture rather than people who are unable to find dates. To demand reading her literally seems surprisingly analogous to forcing a reading of Hanson where he\u2019s pro-rape.  Two takes, which you might not entirely agree with but are unambiguously sympathetic to people unable to find romantic partners, demonstrate the use of the word incel as \u201cmember of a vicious\nhttps:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/think\/opinion\/don-t-let-incel-misogynists-toronto-killer-tell-you-they-ncna869886\nhttps:\/\/www.thestranger.com\/slog\/2018\/04\/25\/26093525\/on-sexual-deprivation-sex-workers-incels-and-violence\nThe context for critiquing incels is immediately following a mass murder by a self identified incel. Unlike with Muslims of Jews or whatever, I have seen very few non-misogynistic people self-identify as an incel (rather than as somebody who can\u2019t find romance, or unattractive or unlovable, or sad virgin etc). I also don\u2019t especially buy that this is as much a uniquely straight male problem as you seem to. I\u2019m gay and experienced a similar stress and self loathing (about being unable to find partners) before I started dating. This tweet in particular seems like a clear explanation of the Ellen pao tweet and some of the unfair vitriol.  https:\/\/twitter.com\/notjessewalker\/status\/992096142723727360 \u201c\u2026~87 bits of information.\u201d That should of course have been *2^87* bits of information. Tiny difference\u2026 non-tight #72: Well, you also need to worry about the constant in the big-O, but fortunately it\u2019s not large.  For reasonable values like \u03b5=\u03b4=1\/5, the theorem really does have the real-world implication that not much communication is needed\u2014especially since O(1\/(\u03b4\u03b52) is just a worst-case upper bound, which is probably achieved only on very weird examples.  See my paper for more (here\u2019s the long version). Scott #71: Nah, no questions right now. But hey, if I think of one, I\u2019ll ask! Mostly, I just appreciated the thought. \ud83d\ude42 Re: \u201cI don\u2019t see how the principle of female bodily autonomy helps when thinking about trolley problems [\u2026]\u201d. Perhaps put the female bodies on one track and the male bodies on the other track, and then see if you agree with Scott about their relative values. J.F. #73: No matter what term we choose for the thing we\u2019re talking about, few people who feel like they still have anything left to lose are going to self-identify as it, no?  At most, you\u2019ll get people self-identifying that the term used to describe them. scott comment #13:\nso we need an organization that does something in line with values we share. well, here\u2019s a partial listing of mine, in order of donation preference:  support for special needs dogs \u2013 dogs with special needs or dogs to help people with special needs (have to be careful. many of these organizations use donations for pay for administrative overhead, rather than for the care of the dogs)  organizations working for the legalization of ALL drugs for ANY adult use.  political organizations promoting radical free market libertarianism (this excludes all \u2018conservative\u2019 organizations or groups that work support government involvement in anything) organizations working to increase either knowledge about the Holocaust to young people or jewish educational values (though not related to theological beliefs). anything in any of these groups work for you? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way the euphemism treadmill worked \u201clonely virgin\u201d is not currently toxic and I think has more self identification than incel. The reason incel is so bad is because the a mass murderer just identified with the term. Virgin is also currently used as a term of abuse more frequently than incel. Incel as a term of abuse is used principally to link people to the ideology (either fairly or as a term of abuse). Virgin is used to shame people for being too nerdy or awkward to be able to find sex. In my mind you were called an incel for the same reason Bush was called a Nazi and Hillary was called a communist. It was an attempt to link you to an odious ideology in order to discredit and insult you.   I guess here is my question. There is currently a viciously misogynistic ideology which is pro-rape, pro-Elliot Rodgers, and often racist being posted on a few subreddits\/chans\/etc which a mass murder believed. The members of this ideology call themselves \u201cincels\u201d.  What would you recommend people call members of this ideological group and what should they call lonely virgins or lonely people unable to find romantic love?  I would argue these terms need to be separated both to not unfairly attack people who are unable to find partners and to not give an iota of credibility to people who celebrate mass murderers. Redistribution of sex sounds creepy, yet the government has long been involved in it. I am speaking of polygamy laws. The purpose of one spouse laws was to equalize sexual (and reproductive) access. This, of course, works best when sex and marriage, like a horse and carriage, were more intimately linked. I would argue that breaking the link between sex and marriage has led to greater sex access inequality, contributing to the problem Robin describes. Thank you for the great, thoughtful post.  We need, as your said, kind, constructive discussion, rather than chains of outrage. It\u2019s definitely inconsistent for progressives to claim to stand for the oppressed, but exceptionalize white men, just because a group of them happen to have power. What people forget is that men who have power, first and foremost, deny resources (and romantic partners) to other men. The poorest, worst off men are often far worse off than the poorest women (similarly in romantic domain, the most successful men get power and multiple partners, while the poorest have no chance at getting partners).  Whether we like it or not, women are the sex that get to be choosier. Hence, the men, who for whatever (even justifiable) reason are not \u201cdesirable\u201d, will end up getting -no- partners (while even the least desirable women have a higher chance of finding partners). This is something we need to address honestly as a society. Maybe the sex part is slightly easier. Be it with good sex robots (which feminists hate), subsidized prostitution or some other idea. The romance part, I really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think Hanson is suggesting anyone should be forced to do anything though.  I\u2019m fully committed to your zeroth commandment. Moreover, as a progressive, I consider it necessary to stand up for every oppressed group or person. I also consider it my duty to promote kindness, and open intellectual discussion. It\u2019s a poison to progressivism to be so intolerant of people\u2019s ideas, and it\u2019s antithesis to single out a group (\u201cwhite men\u201d) as categorically unable to be oppressed.  At schools where I have been (Harvard & MIT), there are no rules against excessive make up, or wearing sexy attire. Not that it happens all the time or I suggest they should be. But there are lots of training, advising against approaching or flirting with a female colleague. I agree, no one should flirt with an unwilling person. But it seems like even taking a minute out of someone\u2019s time to gauge their interest is frowned upon. Where else should we meet  partners? How are we supposed to know if someone is interested in seeing us for coffee? No one is bothered if a girl puts effort into looking \u201cattractive\u201d, but people are plenty bothered by the \u201cattracted\u201d. For those men who aren\u2019t lucky enough to effortlessly attract partners, there must be some way of politely and respectfully express interest, and put effort into convincing a partner (in nature, some birds, who are mostly monogamous like us, spend a long time convincing partners on first encounter). The current culture seems to suggest there is no such way. Not only as a shy man with no conventional attractiveness, you don\u2019t get a good chance of finding a partner, if you go around trying your luck (respectfully) you are categorized as a creep*. There must be a better blueprint, and that requires effort by both the nerds, and their feminist critiques. It can only happen through dialogue and kind cooperation, not through outrage. *I may add, I\u2019ve been lucky enough to have some \u201cconventional\u201d means of attracting people (and have been partnered happily for all of my 20s), like being introduced and advertised by female friends of mine. But I certainly see how many of my shy friends have no way of their own, unless someone like me \u201chelps them\u201d by introducing them to potential partners. Scott #56 I don\u2019t really know what this comment means. The winking smiley indicates that you might be joking about it it? Can you explain what you mean more thoroughly without using irony or hiding your intentions behind an obfuscating joke? Communism didn\u2019t kill 100 million people, this is simply propaganda repeated ad nauseam by twitter pundits and capitalist media. Is there a single methodology you can propose which calculates the deaths of 100 million under communism which wouldn\u2019t result in a much more dire bodycount if we used the exact same methodology for capitalism? In any case, we can look at the massive rise in living standards, health, literacy and so on that communism provided for people and see that yes, it is undoubtedly a more rational system. Like you I\u2019m a non-Christian by both birth and practice, and like you again I am a huge admirer of Christ\u2019s compassion informed by epistemic humility and suspense of judgement. That said, it is hard to believe that you were keeping this ideal in front of you when you write: \n\u201cFor the record: I think that Robin should never, ever have made this comparison, and I wish he\u2019d apologize for it now.  \u2026\u2026  In any event, it seems to me that until we as a society resolve the preliminary question, of whether to recognize a certain category of suffering as real, there\u2019s no point even discussing how policy or culture might help to address the suffering, consistently with the Zeroth Commandment.\u201d When a murderous mob was baying  baying for the blood of a woman accused of adultery, hers wasn\u2019t a suffering that the society of the times recognized as real. Didn\u2019t stop Christ from viewing the situation in terms of a more universal value system. There were times when certain sufferings of gays and women weren\u2019t recognized by society \u2013 would you say the brave outliers who invited and suffered personal ridicule by standing up for them should have desisted from discussing those (and zeroth commandment is irrelevant unless you want to sneakily imply that Robin endorsed violation of it)? You\u2019re wrong in saying \u201cRobin failed to understand\u201d the point you are making. He understood it, but in all likelihood underestimated the extent of misinterpretation and backlash that was to follow, because his primary focus was on addressing the apparent paradox and not in appeasing virtue-signallers. Perhaps here is a point you failed to understand (and sincere apologies for being provocative here, but I can\u2019t resist): following Christ\u2019s combination of truthfulness and compassion has as prerequisite great courage and strength, so as to not capitulate to prevailing orthodoxies. Gandhi had a point in claiming that every human virtue he could think of followed from the one single ideal of truth. Well I thought you were going to wait a few days before participating in the comments Scott \ud83d\ude09 I always find your social commentary posts mostly uplifting. I always feel better when I see people talking about these kinds of problems and approach them in an honest, empathetic way without just trying to declare someone a criminal. I am characterized quite strongly by how you described most \u201cincels\u201d (though for reasons pointed out by other commenters, I would not identify myself as an incel). You did a very good job of detailing what that\u2019s like, so I won\u2019t rehash it. I deleted and rewrote this several times because I wasn\u2019t sure the right amount of information to give. Your 0th law just makes me uncomfortable, because it is very absolute, very specific, and very long. Long, complicated axioms make me feel uncomfortable. I believe something very similar to it. At least for the type of world we live in now, human intelligence is extremely valuable, and should be given the maximum amount of ability to create and express without inhibiting other humans. The body of humans is extremely important for creation and expression, so for most practical purposes, modifying other peoples bodies against their wishes is a deep violation of that ethic. I agree to something very similar to your 0th commandment.  Computation is unstable, and doesn\u2019t really permit a similarity metric in any reasonable sense. Given that so much of our confidence has to deal with the algorithmic approach we use to compute confidence, it should be no surprise that small differences in priors (especially considering they influence the chosen algorithm) would so greatly influence the result. Even simple probabilistic models like Bayes nets are NP-Complete to update. Even approximation is hard, and that is assuming a simple computational model like Bayes nets. The real world seems even more complicated to me. So the computational limitations really seem like the problem Aumann\u2019s Agreement theorem. Even undecidable problems can be solved with few bits of communication complexity. froginthewell #85: I agree that Christ is well-known for having tried to alleviate suffering that those around him didn\u2019t even recognize or acknowledge. But he\u2019s also well-known for having been\u2014you know\u2014crucified. Which is not something that I feel up for right now \u2026 what about you? \ud83d\ude42 Joshua #86: Yeah, that was an attempted commitment device that didn\u2019t work \ud83d\ude42 Richard #80: Among the options you listed, I choose either Holocaust awareness or special needs dogs. Now you name the charity and I\u2019ll give them $100. Scott, you\u2019re a fucking white male, and actually have the nerve to be upset that you feel guilty for it.\nYou\u2019ve got ideas above your station, and no amount of ass-kissing will spare you the punishment they\u2019ve already got planned for you. Scott: I wish I believed in a God who could grant you some kind of eternal salvation, in return for adhering to a higher moral standard throughout your life\u2026 As a follower of Jesus, I don\u2019t believe in a God who does that, either.  Yes, Jesus saves me, but as a gift, not as a reward for above-average morals.  See, for example, the story of the lost son. scott #80. i\u2019ll get back to you on this. in the meantime, you might want to look at https:\/\/www.thedodo.com. it shows videos of rescued animals and the beginning of each video may depress you about how awful some humans are but each video ending may renew your feeling about how terrific other humans can be. i look at it daily to keep my spirits up. I have a number of comments on this.  I\u2019ll try to restrict myself below to what hasn\u2019t already been said by others. Firstly, I think you\u2019re wrong about the reason the existence of \u201cmoderate incels\u201d are ignored.  Reason #1 is of course what other commenters have already said \u2014 \u201cincel\u201d is usually taken to refer to a specific community of people who call themselves that, not to the more general non-group-membership-based set of people the word originally referred to.  As such, the \u201cmoderate incels\u201d you speak of would be considered by most not to be \u201cmoderate incels\u201d but rather not incels.  But reason #2 is that you\u2019re giving people too much credit if you think they in general acknowledge the existence of moderates.  It\u2019s pretty clear in general that ones things get tribal, people will, in fact, deny the existence of moderates on the other side.  If you point these moderates out, they\u2019ll say they\u2019re just as bad as the extremists.  There\u2019s really nothing unusual going on here. Secondly, I think you\u2019re lumping way too much here (except in one respect where I think you\u2019re being needlessly exclusive, but one thing at a time). I don\u2019t think sexually\/romantically frustrated men, or people, are all of a kind, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s useful to discuss them as a coherent group.  I also think it\u2019s just kind of the wrong thing to focus on. I want to go back to\u2026 that specific problem.  You know which one.  The one that inspired comment-171, Scott Alexander\u2019s old \u201cMeditations\u201d series, etc.  The problem isn\u2019t a lack of sex or love or whatever.  That\u2019s just a result of the problem \u2014 and it\u2019s what people always goddamn pattern-match it to when you try to explain, making getting anyone to understand the actual problem quite difficult.  The actual problem is a pretty specific trap that people get themselves into, by taking seriously as moral restrictions various \u201crules\u201d that sound nice but are not in fact good policy \u2014 neither from a practical standpoint nor a moral one \u2014 and aren\u2019t actually obeyed by ordinary people, not even (except in rare cases) by the promulgators of these principles.  The only people actually obeying this crap is fools like us.  (The thing to understand though is that these people honestly do think that what they\u2019re doing matches what they\u2019re saying, because they\u2019re awful at turning off their common-sense filters and interpreting things literally.)  And moreover the problem is not being allowed to question these rules because any attempt to such as ask for clarification gets you demonized.  And moreover\u2026 well, I\u2019ll stop there. Given that it seems that the self-described incel community is in fact not scrupulously concerned with obeying such rules in order to avoid hurting people in even the most minor of ways, but rather seem to be willing to go to means that are morally questionable at best to get what they want, it doesn\u2019t at all seem that they have this same problem.  (Although yeah there might be people who ended up that way because they used to.) I think this specific trap is a specific problem that it makes sense to discuss.  I don\u2019t think this more general thing you\u2019re discussing really is. Like, let me put it this way \u2014 I finally made it out of this trap several years ago.  Has this led to an increase in romantic or sexual success?  Well, um\u2026 no, it hasn\u2019t.  But you know what?  That\u2019s not really important.  What\u2019s important is that this is no longer an area of life that I\u2019m afraid to think clearly about and have to doublethink around.  What\u2019s important is that I\u2019m no longer restraining myself from doing perfectly ordinary things based on paranoia that they could be somehow hurting people in nonsensical ways.  What\u2019s important is that I\u2019m not living in fear anymore.  Don\u2019t confuse the trap itself with the less important things causally downstream from it. The way I think you\u2019re being needlessly exclusive, btw, is that it\u2019s not just men who fall into this particular trap; it is, more generally, people who are attracted to women.  E.g., The Unit of Caring has written about what is very clearly this same problem over on Tumblr. Also note, by the way, that a strict rule against ever touching someone without their consent is one of these rules that is just not tenable.  Let\u2019s break down why: So, first off let\u2019s assume we\u2019re ignoring cases of self-defense, helping someone who\u2019s fallen down, etc., and just focus on what seems to be the intended meaning \u2014 i.e., social touch.  But, if \u201cconsent\u201d here is taken to mean \u201cexplicit consent\u201d, this is clearly ridiculous.  While of course it varies by culture, social touch is something ordinary people, not hobbled by such rules, do all the time, and without it causing harm.  But what if you meant something different?  Like, what if by \u201cconsent\u201d you meant \u201cwhat the person actually wants, regardless of whether they do anything to express it\u201d?  That\u2019s no good;  a rule that requires telepathy is not tenable.  OK \u2014 say we instead mean \u201cwhat the other person actually wants, as may be reasonably inferred from their words and actions and body language\u201d?  Well, now we\u2019re getting somewhere more sensible, but the problem here remains the strictness of the prohibition.  If ultimately you have to rely on inference, which is always uncertain, then a prohibition that strict is equivalent to saying that you must never touch anyone for fear that you\u2019ve inferred incorrectly.  (Oh look.  I\u2019ve just described an important part of the trap in more detail.)  Quite simply, we have to allow for mistakes \u2014 we have to allow room for people to act in good faith; we have to allow room for people to try things and then back off based on reactions that cannot be seen in advance (this in particular is a big one!); we have to allow room for people to apologize if things go much worse than anticipated. In short, what you are proposing is that people already in this trap need a component of that trap reinforced. Now, reading your comment #50, it seems that your point was that people in the trap should not, as happens to some, say \u201cTo hell with morality!  Since people don\u2019t actually obey the rules they state, clearly there are no real rules here, and anything I can get away with goes!\u201d and then joining the \u201cred pill\u201d or \/r\/braincels or whatever, as happens to some.  And indeed, that\u2019s true.  But reinforcing the trap is fundamentally a bad thing.  For those like me who never found such a thing in any way tempting, who always remained fundamentally committed to not hurting people, you\u2019re just pushing us deeper into the trap.  For those who do find a thing tempting, you\u2019re reinforcing the contradictory restrictions that push them to taking such a drastic step.  And, OK, possibly for some it does have the effect you intended of keeping them out of the hands of the redpillers\u2026 but only by pushing them, once again, deeper into the trap.  Don\u2019t do that. Rather the thing to do is to give people the tools to get out of the trap.  (And ideally eventually dismantling it entirely, but one thing at a time.)  That is, unfortunately, much harder to do.  But doing so consists not of giving people more externally-sourced rules to obey, but rather getting them to the point that they can once again trust and rely on their own moral judgment, and be willing to make and learn from good-faith mistakes.  In short, your \u201czeroth commandment\u201d is pushing in exactly the wrong direction. Finally, I have to remark on one more thing: When you speak of the \u201cprecepts of feminism\u201d \u2014 what are those, exactly?  There\u2019s a problem here in that\u2026 well, let me put it this way.  I know and remember the particular feminism I grew up with, and I continue to stand by its principles.  But feminism in general is too heterogeneous to really have common principles.  Radical feminism and liberal feminism come from entirely different starting points (and my own approach, it seems, doesn\u2019t quite match either); meanwhile \u2014 going by what Ozy Frantz says, anyway \u2014 social justice feminism is actually pretty distinct from both.  And then you have crap like \u201ccultural feminism\u201d, which is called such because it grew out of the feminist movement, but whihc is, in plain terms, actually sexism.  As such, it seems a little questionable to endorse the \u201cprecepts of feminism\u201d with no qualifications. But my bigger problem with this is that the actually-existing feminist movement\u2026 hoo boy.  I mean \u2014 I don\u2019t need to tell you; you\u2019ve seen it.  The actually-existing feminist movement seems to have fallen into tribalism hard, and no longer seems to have any actual principles, adopting instead whatever principles are convenient this week for claiming the high ground over whoever it\u2019s now designated an enemy.  I don\u2019t think we should be driving people towards this group.  (Let\u2019s be clear \u2014 the realistic outcome of telling people in this trap that they have to stick to the precepts of feminism (something they already know but let\u2019s ignore that) is more doublethink as they try to reconcile the contradictory precepts of every variety of feminism, including whatever people on the internet are saying these days.  Ugh.  Just writing that sentence brings back some awful memories of my attempts to do just that.)  These days I\u2019m wary of calling myself a \u201cfeminist\u201d at all because of this crap \u2014 or, I sometimes like to say, analogous to libertarian terminology, that I\u2019m a \u201clowercase-f feminist\u201d.  Rather, once again, the idea isn\u2019t to get people to adopt any particular precepts, but to get them to the point where they can once again think for themselves. And if on thinking for themself they turn out to be a horrible sexist\u2026 well, then at least they\u2019re hopefully now the sort of person who one can actually have an argument with, as opposed to a frightened doublethinker.  Honest advocacy of the horrible is much preferable to obfuscation and bullshit. I think that\u2019s all.  And if I had other things to say, that others haven\u2019t already, well, I don\u2019t remember them! I liked this post, thanks for writing it. #91: Wow.  So even if I accepted Christ as Savior, that still wouldn\u2019t solve the basic emotional problem that I\u2019d want any religion to solve for me\u2014namely, fixing the apparently meaningless and staggering injustices of the world (e.g., via the mechanism of an afterlife).  That\u2019s \u2026 good to know, I guess.  Thanks! \ud83d\ude42 Everyone: OK, I\u2019m persuaded.  No need to keep flogging the deceased equine. For now, and probably for years into the future, the word \u201cincel\u201d suffers from the motte-and-bailey problem, as astutely observed by Danny #66.  I.e., people do, and will, use the word to virgin-shame, to bully for sport, to instill terror (like Ellen Pao did), to smear innocent victims of circumstances who already suffer far more than than share\u2014and will then retreat, when challenged (but only when challenged), to \u201coh, no, I was only talking about the violent misogynists of the incel movement.\u201d  Decent people will need to remain alert to such chicanery. In the long run, though, there\u2019s no salvaging this word.  It will never again just mean \u201cinvoluntary celibate,\u201d any more than, I don\u2019t know, the word \u201cNazi\u201d will ever again just mean someone who\u2019s both a nationalist and a socialist, like one of those voters who was supposedly split between Trump and Bernie Sanders. Maybe the older term \u201clove-shy,\u201d coined by Brian Gilmartin in his strange and remarkable book on the subject, is the best available substitute. scott #80. as a disabled person, confined to a power chair because i have a total lack of balance (due to total bilateral vestibular loss as a result of having CIDP \u2013 life is tough), i looked for an organization that trains dogs for people who need balance and mobility assistance. i found two candidates: https:\/\/www.keystonehumanservices.org\/susquehanna-service-dogs\/balance-dogs.php https:\/\/paws4people.org\/can-get-dog-1\/575-2\/ either of these organizations seem suitable to me. when you write your check for a $100 donation, you might (or might not) want to mention how you learned of their work. as my mother would tell me: may it be written in the Book of Life on Yom Kippur that you have performed this mitvah. although, as a theoretical physicist, i don\u2019t believe this but it\u2019s the thought that counts \ud83d\ude42 and i thank you for doing this.  richard Richard #97: OK, it\u2019s done (the Keystone balance dogs). Now who else have I offended? \ud83d\ude42 Scott, I think the problem with this post and possibly the main cause of the whole debacle is down to a misunderstanding.  To most people who were familiar with the term before this news cycle, Incel does not mean all people who are \u201cInvoluntarily Celibate\u201d. Incel is an ideology, popularised on certain 4chan boards and r\/incel, that outright calls for the dehumanisation and commodification of women. To the  (possibly majority of) people who follow this definition, defending \u201cmoderate incels\u201d is like defending \u201cmoderate ISIS fighters\u201d. In other words, the people who follow different definitions are talking past each other. I also disagree with normalising the term \u201cIncel\u201d as this article does \u2013 the word will never, ever leave it\u2019s baggage behind, and there are plenty of healthy, less loaded alternatives. Sniffnoy #93: Thank you so much for that comment, which was a masterpiece of clear mathematician-style reasoning applied to human affairs (or, what might amount to the same thing: clear philosophical analysis).  You\u2019ve convinced me on almost everything. Please believe me that my intention, with the Zeroth Commandment (and with my exhortation to commit to \u201cthe precepts of feminism\u201d), was not to make the scrupulosity problems of the people who suffer from them even worse.  Let me put it this way: when you commit to being a kind and decent person in all your romantic interactions (or \u201cattempted romantic interactions\u201d) with women, you certainly don\u2019t need to do anything more than what the progressive cultural authorities in these matters\u2014i.e., the ones who constantly attack us nerds on Twitter, the ones who go by gut feelings rather than by the literal meanings of words\u2014would accept as being a kind and decent person.  E.g., if even they would call a kiss consensual \u2014because your date, though she never verbally consented to be kissed, did close her eyes and part her lips as you moved your face close to hers, and then three seconds later was jabbing her tongue in your mouth\u2014then for purposes of the Zeroth Commandment, the kiss was consensual. \ud83d\ude42 My intent with the Commandment, rather, was that scrupulosity-afflicted male nerds should morally fortify themselves, that they should do the daily \u201cspiritual work\u201d of recommitting to being kind and decent people in the above sense, even if the universe is fundamentally capricious and unjust, and even if the nerds will spend their lives being lectured on their feminist failings by men who, in practice, are a thousandth as feminist as they.  This is difficult, and it\u2019s necessary.  It\u2019s a categorical imperative. One remaining disagreement: while you almost had me convinced that we should focus on the general problems of nerdish scrupulosity, and overliteral interpretation of rules, rather than romantic and sexual frustration in particular, the following gave me serious pause. So now that you think so much more clearly about it: what, in your view, are the remaining obstacles in your way?  Because whatever those obstacles are, they seem to me like they should also be part of the conversation. Setanta #99: As I said above, I\u2019ve already ceded the point about the word \u201cincel.\u201d  But I can\u2019t agree that it\u2019s all just a misunderstanding, because of the motte-and-bailey problem.  I.e., experience has shown that the moment they\u2019re no longer being challenged about it, the powerful people of our society will go right back to attributing to every nerdy young love-shy guy, some form of the most violent and misogynistic beliefs ever to have been found on r\/incels.  And this conflation\u2014by design\u2014will let the \u201cnormies\u201d maintain pristine consciences, even as the well-meaning love-shys\u2019 suicidal suffering continues to go not merely unacknowledged and unaddressed, but actively made worse by the culture. As if to prove my point, the user \u201cqueerbees\u201d recently wrote on SneerClub, in response to this post: On the contrary, I understand precisely that this is what this is really about.  And as someone who developed an almost paternal feeling toward the love-shy young guys, having read so many of their heartbreaking stories in the wake of the comment-171 affair\u2014well, I didn\u2019t ask for this fight, and it does nothing for me personally, but now that I\u2019m in, I\u2019ll continue to stand up for these guys for as long as I live and as long as they\u2019re being unjustly attacked. Scott #102: I agree that this might be a motte-and-bailey problem, as you suggest. However, I still think that this might also be a framing issue. If you give someone the same base facts, but describe it as \u201clove-shy nerds who haven\u2019t found the right person\u201d, then this issue wouldn\u2019t even come up. *Because* it came up in the context of a murderer, \u201cextremist incel\u201d, then people are predisposed to looking at this as originating from bad beliefs. Or at least, that\u2019s my guess. Well, I for one think it\u2019s time to stand up for the Indumb community! That\u2019s right, we who are involuntarily dumb need to have a level playing field, and we demand restitution! Nobody gives a damn about those of us who struggle to understand quantum computing the way that MIT prodigies do, and it\u2019s just because we happen live inside chiseled bodies and are able to readily grasp unspoken social rules and effortlessly engage in flirty banter with strangers.  Scott is a jerk if he doesn\u2019t immediately dedicate his career to the creation of an IQ redistribution treatment. (This is a total throwaway comment not meant to endorse any side of this debate. I just though the notion was humorous.) I mean, de Finetti gave a concrete example, before Hanson was born, in which three different hyper-rational Bayesians with identical priors would have three different updates on identical evidence, but sure, whatever. A lot of people are asserting that \u201cthere are no moderate incels\u201d, and I find the assertion troubling. Let\u2019s take a narrow definition of incel: someone who regularly visits r\/braincels or wizardchan or the like, reads the toxic stuff there and self-identifies as incel. Lots of these people don\u2019t hate women.  Have you ever read the incel forums? Not just scanned the headlines or looked at the most outrageous thread, but actually sat down for a couple hours and observed the community? There are tons of people deep in incel culture who have simply convinced themselves that they\u2019re too ugly\/autistic\/nonaggressive to ever find love, and go there because it\u2019s the one place they\u2019ve found where they can even acknowledge their problem without sparking a comment-171 inquisition. The radicals condemn slutty women who prefer to sleep around with higher-status men: if all women settled down with a partner, then an equal gender ratio guarantees the incel would find a partner. But it\u2019s perfectly possible to hold that that happens without condemning women: they\u2019re just following their own incentives without directly harming anyone, can\u2019t blame them, it just sucks for the incel that society works out that way.  Furthermore, it\u2019s possible to hang out in incel culture where the radicals shout these things without believing them at all. The assumption people here seem to be making is that everyone who participates in incel culture must be so radicalized that it\u2019s appropriate to compare them to ISIS. I reiterate my question: how long have you spent looking at incel culture? I think that anyone who makes this claim is acting just like the Islamophobe who lumps Muslims into \u201cSuicide bombers\u201d and \u201cCollaborators\u201d. No, some people just like going to their mosque, even if it\u2019s got some angry people, because at least it lets them feel like they\u2019re not alone. I only learned the word \u201cincel\u201d recently by reading SSC and Hanson\u2019s blog, but I wonder if this whole issue has larger geopolitical implications. Specifically, what happens when a huge Chinese generational cohort heavily tilted toward males (something like 118 males for every 100 females, according to one news source) hits its 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s? In this country, it seems, self-identifying radical \u201cincels\u201d are restricted to the farthest fringes of Reddit, but what happens when they number in the millions and need a way to vent their frustration and aggression? Maybe figuring out how to deal with this issue in the U.S. would help to figure out how to deal with it in other places, on much larger scales. (For the record, I have no sympathy or respect for capital-I \u201cIncels\u201d who just seem to be ticked off that they can\u2019t get the kind of women they see on TV.) \u201cCompassion\u201d is not a solution to anything, nor a strategy for anything. It\u2019s a band-aid at best, empty virtue-signalling at worst. Compassion allows the compassionate to congratulate himself on his humanity without producing any change in behavior. It encourages people to believe, as Muriel Spark noted, \u201cthat their moral responsibilities are sufficiently fulfilled by the emotions they have been induced to feel.\u201d In short, it is a substitute for charity. \u201cCompassion\u201d is a loaded, terrible word. A nice, brave piece, though. Scott #95 My apologies in advance for immersing myself in this exchange. I can only speak of my experience, of course, but I can definitely say that accepting Christ as my Savior was the big breakthrough in my life (it happened around 10 years ago) and I have never looked back. What \u201caccepting Christ as my Savior\u201d means in technical terms is very profound in fact. It\u2019s the recognition that we, human beings, are rotten to our core and that there is no human way of making us whole. No kings, no human laws, not even divine laws (God passed the 10 commandments to Moses and He wasn\u2019t very successful). God tried all that as illustrated in the Jewish Bible to no avail. He -God on the person of Jesus Christ- had to write himself in the human story to take upon himself -as a git to humanity- all our sins and pay the price of dying in the cross.  Now, as James would tell you having Christ as your Savior does not in anyway mean you have a license to be a crook. On the contrary, it\u2019s the biggest incentive to be a good fellow human: https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=James+1&version=ESV https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=James+2&version=ESV Now, I don\u2019t know the reasons why God created a world in which humans inevitably go wrong. I guess free-will has something to do with it. If we were robots, no worries when it comes to people doing horrible things, but perhaps we wouldn\u2019t have all the wonderful creative things human beings do as well, or the heroism exemplified by Oskar Schindler and Dietrich Bonhoeffer among others. On the personal level, accepting Christ as one\u2019s Savior works wonders, even though the reason I accepted that is because I became convinced of the truth, but it is a nice byproduct. A friend of mine, who is much wiser and more thoughtful than me once said in rebuke \u201cthere but for the grace of God\u201d. Who and where you are now it\u2019s due mostly to luck. Born with the right genes to the right parents in the right place; the right early life with the right breaks. Without that, you to might be the thief, the peadophile\u2026 DeservingPorcupine #103: Scott is a jerk if he doesn\u2019t immediately dedicate his career to the creation of an IQ redistribution treatment. You think it\u2019s a joke, but I actually take the question completely seriously. The problem, of course, is that IQ is one of the notoriously hardest things to raise by any intervention.  Well over half of the variation is genetic, with the remainder being mostly stuff that no one understands.  Breastfeeding probably helps; a lead-free environment definitely does.  Early childhood education might possibly have some effect if you squint, but in any case, the effect is hard to distinguish from zero. Knowledge, on the other hand, clearly can be spread around.  And you know what job is?  I\u2019m a professor.  I, like, literally spend most of my life trying to redistribute knowledge from the \u201chaves\u201d to the \u201chave-nots\u201d! \ud83d\ude42 Beyond that, when it becomes feasible and safe to raise the IQs of newborns via targeted genetic interventions\u2014most likely in the very near future\u2014I passionately believe that we should go ahead and do it.  I\u2019m much less worried about the immorality of \u201cplaying God\u201d this way, than about the converse: the immorality of letting our children grow up dumb when simply sweeping some mutational load from their DNA would have prevented it. Like, it\u2019s not as if the children produced this way will be cloned, soulless robots from some sci-fi dystopia, any more than IVF babies are.  They\u2019ll be normal, happy, healthy children who look like their parents\u2014just with higher IQs, fewer genetic diseases, and fewer problems in life. Phil Koop #104: Do you want to actually explain this?  Robin and Tyler were expositing Aumann\u2019s agreement theorem, which was published in 1976 (unless you\u2019re claiming that de Finetti or someone else knew it earlier, in which case, source?).  And whatever it is you\u2019re talking about, I can guarantee that it doesn\u2019t violate Aumann\u2019s theorem.  How I can do that, despite not knowing what you\u2019re talking about?  Well, that\u2019s the cool thing about a theorem! \ud83d\ude42 aussiesta #107: I actually completely agree with you that compassion, by itself, is not a solution to anything. What it is, precisely, is a prerequisite to solutions.  If there\u2019s no compassion for group X, then the conversation about how to solve group X\u2019s problems never even gets off the ground. The other truth no one likes to acknowledge \u2013 the dating market is completely based on lies and deception. Gatekeepers #108: I\u2019m not big on quibbling with others\u2019 sincere religious faith, but there was one bit of your comment that leapt out at me.  God had to allow the Holocaust to happen, in order that we could all be inspired by heroism of Oskar Schindler (who managed to save 1,200 Jews out of 6 million)?  You really believe that? More broadly: as Steven Weinberg once put it, it seems unfair that his relatives should have been murdered, in order that Germans could have free will.  Why couldn\u2019t God, in His omnipotence, have created a world where, if you misuse your free will, the tragic consequences befall no one but yourself? To what extent do online critics of this aspect of nerd culture actually affect the mental state of nerds?  I\u2019m one of those people whose computer-related talents are accompanied by a lack of social skills.  I would say that I am rather lonely.  But online criticism has very little ability to upset me directly \u2013 to paraphrase, the critics \u201cmerely adopted the internet, I was born in it, molded by it.\u201d  This is the one place where I belong and they are hapless interlopers, fit only to be trolled. So to Scott: I respect your compassion towards your fellow nerds, and I support your efforts to help them.  But do nerds need to be protected from the people you are trying to protect them from here?  I would say no \u2013 if other nerds are anything like me, that sort of attack stopped affecting them some time in middle school.  So keep up the good work, but don\u2019t listen to the critics unless doing so amuses you (which it does not appear to do). Scott #110: Yeah, I pretty much agree with you on all points.  And FWIW you do a good job! I frequently credit an interview with you I read a while ago as being the only mainstream, non-specialist discussion of quantum computing that actually increased my understanding of the topic (instead of the usual two-states-good-unlimited-states-better description you get everywhere). Scott #114 I don\u2019t have an answer to your questions. All I can give you is my personal thinking of how I deal with the same questions. I think I mentioned elsewhere that despite having been raised in a Christian home I became an atheist\/agnostic during college; my unbeliever phase lasted anywhere between 12 to 15 years since as much as I remember vividly the circumstances that led to my reversion I have very messy memories of how is that I lost my faith other than the peer pressure of \u201csmart people don\u2019t believe in God\u201d. I fully empathize with the notion that not understanding why there is evil in the world is a big obstacle for many people -particularly nerdy\/smart people- to believe in a Creator. And yet, one of the leaps of faith I had to take when I recovered my faith around 10 years ago is that there will always be things that God does as an all powerful being that I won\u2019t be able to understand, particularly those things that send strong signals to humanity about the things that should not be happening because some humans use their strength to abuse the weak. If you read about the life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, not only he was vehemently opposed to the genocide of Jews, he was also vehemently opposed to the program through which Nazi Germany polished its industrial killing machine:  https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Aktion_T4 . Bonhoeffer came back to Germany -despite having found safe refuge in the US- to fight that atrocity fully knowing that being executed -as it happened- by the Hitler regime was a possibility. When I hear these days mentions to all sorts of programs that are eugenics in disguise like designer babies or as you know a subject that is very dear to my heart -the elimination of Down Syndrome people through abortion in Iceland- it pains me that many haven\u2019t learned their history lesson despite having had 6 million Jews and hundreds of thousands of handicapped Germans killed by the same ideas.  It seems to me that we, humans, are a very stubborn class that need periodic reminder of God\u2019s laws.  This whole discussion about labeling male nerds who are already dealing with the pain of being unable to relate to humans of the opposite sex is a great example of the thinking I am talking about. \u201cLet\u2019s profile them\u201d, \u201clet\u2019s differentiate the misogynistic ones from the good ones\u201d, etc. All this as if we, humans, have the infinite wisdom and ability to foresee and predict which of these \u201cnerds\u201d is a potential Elliot Rodger as opposed to a potential Scott Aaronson. This is humans playing to be God all over again. I agree that more compassion is the solution. From the undeniable fact that we simply didn\u2019t choose who we are\u2026 Two more notes: \u2013 I\u2019m wondering more and more what impact virtual reality will have on all this, i.e. adding one more level of indirection to all human interactions (while preserving or even enhancing the experience of the senses). \u2013 About \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as rational disagreement\u201d, I wonder if that can be applied on how the different subsystems of the brain interact with one another. Scott #15 \u201cpeople will only pay attention when there\u2019s some terrible episode of violence, or toxic subcultures that celebrate it; ergo the new term will acquire the same radioactive connotations; ergo those who want to discuss the broader issue will need to find yet another term, and so on forever. Or am I wrong?\u201d Right \u2013 if someone wants to promote and discuss the benefits of some form of \u201cnational socialist\u201d doctrine, well, they\u2019re out of luck\u2026 \ud83d\ude1b I\u2019m curious what it would mean to misuse your free will in a world where the consequences befall no one but yourself. Is it even possible to have free will in such a place? If I have free will, then it should at least be possible for me to choose to harm others. But such an action would be a \u201cmisuse\u201d of free will, so I should be the only one facing the consequences of this action. But then I must have never harmed anyone (other than myself) in the first place. \u201cMy view is this: the world in which a comparison between the sufferings of the romantically and the monetarily impoverished could increase normal people\u2019s understanding of the former, is so different from our world as to be nearly unrecognizable.\n\u2026\nFor experience shows that, if you even breathe a phrase like \u201cthe inequality of romantic and sexual fulfillment,\u201d no one who isn\u2019t weird in certain ways common in the hard sciences (e.g., being on the autism spectrum) will be able to parse you\u2026\u201d I\u2019m not on the spectrum \u2013 so far as I know \u2013 and I can parse it. Anyone who has adopted the Bodhisattva path or trained their mind in compassion will be able to parse it.  Suffering is suffering. There are a million forms of it and all sentient beings wish to avoid it and wish for happiness. We are all alike in that way. Our modern culture does not agree. In modern society, righteousness reins supreme. This is the culture that celebrates the execution of Bin Laden with glee and condemns Robbie Parker for having the gall to forgive the killer of his little girl before she was even in the ground: https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2012\/12\/16\/us\/connecticut-emilie-parker\/index.html Our society wants to parcel out who is deserving of our compassion (and in what measure) and who is utterly undeserving. BTW, I am not claiming any immunity to this. I fall far short of the goal I have set according to my spiritual heroes. Donald Trump by all accounts is a thoroughly miserable person who suffers greatly. It must be shear agony to be Donald Trump. But woe to any liberal who expresses any compassion for him. And utter contempt from any conservative who dares to think Donny suffers\u2026 he is rich and powerful and has all of life\u2019s privileges after all. I think you have a lot of compassion Scott, and a love for truth, humanity and shared understanding. I rejoice that you do. Very well written article, and I strongly agree with everything you said. One small piece of tactical advice; if you write anything on this topic in the future , maybe avoid the word \u201cincels\u201d?    I think many people associate that term with the reddit incel subreddit, which was a pretty toxic and misogynist group that was eventually banned for harassing people.   Maybe just talk about socially awkward men who can\u2019t find romance or whatever without using that term? Just a thought; I think that was one of the mistakes Hanson made was that by using that term he wandered into a meme minefield that he didn\u2019t need to. I know how to solve the incel dilemma: Government subsidized plastic surgery for all ugly men.  This way, the imbalance in the sexual marketplace is taken care of in such a way that it doesn\u2019t violate female sexual autonomy. We as a society pretend looks don\u2019t matter for attraction, when it reality, looks are critically important. The vast majority of incels are that way because they are physically \u201coff\u201d in some way \u2013 facially ugly, very short, very uncoordinated, or have a noticeable physical disability.  Granted, there are others who are just mentally fucked up, like the guy in the recent terrorist attack, but the majority are incel because of PHYSICAL problems. When you see ugly guy\/beautiful woman couples, there\u2019s almost always an ulterior motive on her part.  We need to stop bullshitting ourselves. Women are only \u201cless visual\u201d in a pragmatic and practical way, not in a \u201csexual\u201d way like men desperately want to believe.  If a man doesn\u2019t have the looks for love, and isn\u2019t wealthy enough to \u201cattract\u201d someone willing to merely SETTLE for him, he\u2019s going to be an incel. Subsidizing plastic surgery is going to be expensive, yes, but that pales in comparison to the cost of doing nothing. Nowadays, women are able to support themselves, leaving them free to choose mates based on raw sexual attraction, and this trend is only going to be MORE pronounced and obvious as the younger generations come of age.  This means the number of incels is going to grow exponentially.   What is at stake, here, is the future of western civilization itself.  Having too many leftover males around will ultimately decimate the economy, not to mention rising crime rates, misogyny and all manner of other unwelcome trends.  If we want our children and grandchildren to have a future to look forward to, we absolutely MUST find a way to improve unattractive men\u2019s physical appearance!  Not doing so will be FAR more costly than giving them plastic surgery, I guarantee it! To show just how sick our society has come with regarding righteousness anger >> compassion see how Robbie Parker\u2019s compassionate attitude toward his little girl\u2019s killer was immediately used to claim Sandy Hook was a hoax: https:\/\/www.quora.com\/If-Sandy-Hook-was-not-a-hoax-how-do-you-explain-the-Robbie-Parker-video One can see twitter and social media in general as exposing just what a problem our culture has with addiction to righteousness. Also, note that even the \u2018rationalist\u2019 in that post who concludes that, \u201cFinally, this is literally the most offensive conspiracy theory I\u2019ve ever come across.\u201d says that Robbie Parker\u2019s response was an example where, \u201cPeople often have inappropriate responses to heightened emotional situations\u201d The idea that anyone could respond without righteous anger to such a situation is near incomprehensible to our society. We are addicted to it.  Drawing attention to any group which manifestly suffers that is not on our societies approved list of groups\/people worthy of compassion will immediately incur wrath precisely because of this addiction. Who is not worthy of compassion and is only deserving of utter contempt and righteous anger? Adam Lanza,\nOsama Bin Laden,\nISIS,\nDonald Trump,\nISIS,\nIncels,\nConservatives,\nLiberals,\n\u2026\ntons of things and people\n\u2026\nthose who express any kind of compassion for anyone on this list Rinse, recycle, repeat. I\u2019d add that a substantial reason people are reluctant to acknowledge those who can\u2019t get sex deserve sympathy and are being screwed over by the universe is because it would involve having to admit that there was nothing that could be done about a deep unfairness. I think many people try and ignore the fact that we are often stuck in situations where we can\u2019t make things fair. Scott #96, I\u2019m sure you know this, but the Nazis were anything but socialist; just because the Nazi party had socialism in its name doesn\u2019t mean that its actions and principles had anything to do with what is communly called  socialism. David #120: It seems to me that we need merely posit a world with a heaven and hell, where all the injustices resulting from people using their free will to help or harm others got evened out.  It\u2019s a pity that I see no evidence that that world is ours. (Interestingly, when I introspect about which emotional chords religion could pluck in me, I find that I don\u2019t particularly care about immortality.  I.e., I\u2019d be totally fine with a heaven and hell that weren\u2019t eternal, just as long as they lasted long enough to mete out cosmic justice.) Excellent post, Scott. Reading it was like watching a hire-wire artist make his way from one building to another in gale-force winds. \ud83d\ude42 (Hope that doesn\u2019t come off as snarky; I wish your essay would be reprinted in the New York Times.) Kevin #129: Yeah, that\u2019s pretty much what I was going for!  When I\u2019m getting attacked on r\/slatestarcodex as a contemptible spineless coward quaking in fear of his left-wing feminist overlords, and am also getting attacked on r\/SneerClub as a secret redpill misogynist and terrible human being, that\u2019s when I can go to sleep knowing that I\u2019ve done my job. Too much meta. Find a specific policy and champion it. Hint: It is probably legal prostitution. Maybe I read through this too quickly, but nowhere did I see anyone make these two (very obvious) points: 1) Priorities. Wealth inequality is vastly higher than that of the other sort and causes vastly more suffering (IMHO, of course.) 2) These so-called incels are, for the most part, not really incels. Case in point: that guy in grad school who was telling everyone how he couldn\u2019t \u2018get a date\u2019 to use a circumlocution. When I offered to take him down to the Silver Bullet and guaranteed he could go home with somebody that night, he hastily \u2014 and emphatically \u2014 demurred. Turns out what he _really_ meant is he thought he deserved to be with a woman \u2014 preferably a six-foot tall Asian woman \u2014 who was at least a nine on the hotness scale \u2026 because he was getting a PhD in mathematics. This despite the fact that he was rather slovenly, was at least a hundred pounds overweight, and frequently had, er, odor issues. That Hansen wasted any time at all on this problem and didn\u2019t notice these two rather obvious factors to boot doesn\u2019t exactly make the case for his intelligence. Scott: Here\u2019s a recent model of political division that I learned somewhere from your favorite blog, Slate Star Codex, that can perhaps explain people\u2019s reactions. It\u2019s called something like Problem Theorists vs Conflict Theorists and it\u2019s quite cynical, but perhaps you\u2019ll find it interesting. As an example, you may find that two people may both state that, e.g., sexual discrimination is bad, but for completely different reasons. \u201cProblem\u201d theorists like you start from how wasteful it is to throw away people with potential, how cruel it is to destroy their dreams, etc. \u201cConflict\u201d theorists would also agree with those sentiments, but they don\u2019t start there. They start from the idea of class warfare, that these practices of discrimination are designs of the Oppressors against the Oppressed, and it\u2019s not sufficient to merely ban discrimination (and enforce the law), one must actually pay damages for decades of oppression, even fire (possibly competent) people from their jobs to be replaced by the (perhaps even incompetent) candidates from the oppressed to balance the scales to make sure that another imbalance doesn\u2019t quickly redevelop. Having that model in mind, some of the responses to Hanson\u2019s article are very predictable. Hanson\u2019s writing like a Problem Theorist, stating in his mind what is wrong and why. Conflict Theorists, on the other hand, take him for a Conflict Theorist; the only reason one would write such a thing is to advance the agenda of his class. (Conflict Theorists can definitely understand a theory as it is \u201cliterally\u201d written, but they would disagree with this premise or that and ultimately reject that it\u2019s the Simple Truth. They\u2019d always find it more likely that there\u2019s an agenda behind it.) Those so-called incels who advocate violence and think that the world owes them sex are also Conflict Theorists. Saying controversial things, even as controversial as Hanson\u2019s, is how you move the Overton window tho. Just like Trump has \ud83d\ude42 I simply want to express my support for you Scott, for this excellent and courageous post. While the TOC blog-sphere for the recent weeks or so seems to melt down to hollow virtue signaling (with mass cross-posting of the same posts), you seem to stand your ground and hold on to your identity and independence. arbitrary value (#115) Says: \u201cTo what extent do online critics of this aspect of nerd culture actually affect the mental state of nerds?\u201d It pisses me off quite a bit. Some scars run deep. When I was in elementary school I heard a story about a boy that everybody ignored and nobody ever talked to, who supposedly collapsed dead one day as a result, while he was waiting to board the bus. My immediate thought was that he had it pretty good \u2014 nobody was harassing him or physically threatening him. The redistribution of wealth implies (possibly essentially equals..) redistribution of sexual\/romantic satisfaction..That is, what\u2019s to a significant extent causing these bad \u201cmating-choices\u201d and destructive sexual\/romantic frustration is not that women, or men for that matter, are inherently bad, or too \u201cfree\u201d or whatever. Rather it\u2019s that they are not free enough, due to extreme (and increasing) concentrations of wealth causing a perverted human habitat that endorses these biologically suboptimal behaviours. thank you Scott. I had the same thoughts about \u2018incel\u2019 the word and concept as Alana used it. It seemed to me useful but now beyond redemption as you say. Going to listen to \u2018Eleanor Rigby\u2019 again, our anthem \u2013 not much use for recruiting or rabble-rousing though.  \u2018It will never again just mean \u201cinvoluntary celibate,\u201d any more than \u201cAdolf\u201d is just a name.\u2019 I just read Trevor Noah\u2019s autobiography (so far) Born A Crime. He had a good friend named Adolf, who was the best dancer in the township. They went to perform at a Jewish school and Trevor\u2019s team was chanting in praise of Adolf. It didn\u2019t end well.\nThe book is highly recommended, funny and enlightening.\nAnother striking point \u2013 Trevor observes that crime has after-school programs and paid internships, unlike capitalism. I\u2019m glad the issue of terminology was cleared up fairly quickly (otherwise this would have been the same boring comment as elsewhere). I was a little bit surprising by your endorsement of Sniffnoy\u2019s comment, and pleased to see some pushback: \nOne remaining disagreement: while you almost had me convinced that we should focus on the general problems of nerdish scrupulosity, and overliteral interpretation of rules, rather than romantic and sexual frustration in particular, the following gave me serious pause. \u201cLike, let me put it this way \u2014 I finally made it out of this trap several years ago. Has this led to an increase in romantic or sexual success? Well, um\u2026 no, it hasn\u2019t. But you know what? That\u2019s not really important. What\u2019s important is that this is no longer an area of life that I\u2019m afraid to think clearly about and have to doublethink around.\u201d So now that you think so much more clearly about it: what, in your view, are the remaining obstacles in your way? Because whatever those obstacles are, they seem to me like they should also be part of the conversation.\n Scrupulosity could be part of the problem: I\u2019ve worried in the past that looking for explicit consent is sometimes a turn off. But I don\u2019t really have evidence that it\u2019s a problem and I\u2019ve come to think of it as an excuse. Why do many people like me have trouble getting into relationships? Well, here\u2019s something: https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSfzY5lTjMvzmkw2daeBsUCbz54gehU4gXHnJ4augSDJu9R2Sg\/viewanalytics 89.6% of SlateStarCodex readers are men. So assuming SlateStarCodex readers want to date other SlateStarCodex readers, I\u2019m in a pretty bad position.  Now, I don\u2019t insist on dating SSC readers but when I expand my horizons, things still look pretty lopsided. I\u2019m betting Shtetl Optimized readers look a lot like SSC readers. The computer science community more broadly has a serious gender imbalance. Academia doesn\u2019t (I\u2019m pretty sure), but there seems to be a values\/attraction gap between CS\/math\/physics and the more women-dominated fields of academia. You know who has a favorable imbalance towards men? The Orthodox Jewish community \u2013 they have a \u201cShidduch crisis\u201d of women being unable to find relationships! That\u2019s from a combination of a high-growth rate community where men marry younger women (of whom there are a lot more) and of men leaving  the faith in higher numbers than women. Yeah, well, we made our choices.  Who else? The former Soviet Union! (http:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2015\/08\/14\/why-the-former-ussr-has-far-fewer-men-than-women\/) A major imbalance in sex-ratios makes it a lot easier to get a date if you\u2019re a Russian man.  And then there\u2019s China, as Bob Strauss (#106) points out above. There it\u2019s the men who vastly outnumber the women, and may all the imaginary deities save us\u2026 I\u2019m not saying the many American men who have non-existent love lives are SlateStarCodex reading computer scientists, who are trying to find love at LessWrong meetups or Federated Logic Conferences. But a lot of them have found themselves in male dominated sub-communities, and communities are where we meet people. And I think this has a lot more explanatory power than gesturing in the direction of being too punctilious about consent even if there\u2019s more to the story than demographics alone. It could be that much of the reason romantically unsuccessful straight nerdy mails get so little compassion is because they tend to become both financially and romantically successful over time and hence their current status is viewed as temporary or self-inflicted or imaginary, especially by people whose problems are much more intractable. Free will is a funny thing. You can twist it and turn it to support any argument. You can use it to claim that women have free will over their bodies and prostitution should be illegal, or to claim exactly the opposite \u2013 that it was their choice \u2013 and that prostitution should be legal, as the women\u2019s own choice.  The truth is that some people\u2019s wills are stronger than others, and whatever broad generalization you\u2019ll make will always miss the most important factor, which is the personality of the subject.  As for compassion, society really sucks at that. It doesn\u2019t take long these days to get from, say, compassion to LGBT, to overzealous supporting, to LGBT couples terrorizing small businesses who feel uncomfortable with them. Society doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s compassion, it\u2019s limited to the most dumb logic of giving various labels and then classifying those labels as \u2018bad\u2019 or \u2018good\u2019 according to the local media interests. The fewer stupid labels the better. People are better off just dealing with other people as they are, the less stupid labels giving prejudice the better.  Asking for anything \u2018good\u2019 (e.g. compassion\/understanding) for any \u2018bad\u2019 label (e.g. white nerd males) will be met with bad results. Back to the subject of free will, when looking at the way groups of people behave, you really have to wonder where all the complexity of the so called free will is gone, and why is the result so predictable and dumb. @Sniffoy#93- I\u2019m not buying that the feminist rules are the problem. As I mentioned above, there are also children afraid of becoming pedophiles and the rules regarding pedophilia are pretty clear. The problem is the whole \u201cIf you say you\u2019re afraid of doing this, then you really want to do it\u201d attitude. If feminists said \u201cThese are the rules, if you find yourself afraid of violating them and nobody thinks you\u2019re a jerk, you might want to consider seeing  a therapist, there\u2019s plenty of other people like you\u201d, then that would be perfectly acceptable. Instead, they pretend that everyone who complains is a wannabe sexual predator. There really do exist extremist Muslims, who bomb schools and buses, or cheer and pass out candies when that happens, and who wish to put the entire world under Sharia on point of the sword.  Fortunately, the extremists are outnumbered by hundreds of millions of reasonable Muslims, with whom anyone, even a Zionist\u2026  Oh how I wish, I wish that that were true.  Unfortunately, while the number of reasonable Muslims number in the hundreds of millions, the number of totalitarian supporters also number in the hundreds of millions.  Here\u2019s some facts: 1.  There have been 5 islamic genocides in my lifetime alone\n2.  There are 13 countries that would execute me as an atheist, all of them Islamic\n3.  The islamic world is the only place where slavery is still defended\n4.  There \u2013 you know what?  I\u2019ve written vast amounts on this: https:\/\/www.skepticink.com\/prussian\/2018\/02\/28\/islam-in-practice\/ I agree with you about the general post though, on this specific issue, I submit there is some evidence the other way. Scott, You propose that the only reason for the differing reactions to Amia Srinivasan\u2019s essay and Robin Hanson\u2019s is that Srinivasan talks about objects of progressive sympathy and Hanson talks of ones of progressive contempt.   Could we perhaps instead start by noting, as you yourself observed, that Hanson is flat out terrible in communicating his ideas, while Srinivasan is extremely effective.    And perhaps we could go further to note (as you didn\u2019t) that Hanson is an amateur at the topic he took up in his essay, while it\u2019s an area to which Srinivasan is an expert.   And finally, I can\u2019t help but notice the difference in how you discuss the thought and writings of Oxford professor Srinivasan (\u201cbeautifully written\u201d, \u201cwise and nuanced and humane\u201d) vs. how you describe the thoughts and writings of George Mason professor Hanson (\u201cworldview-destabilizing\u201d, \u201cprototype of what you want more of in academia\u201d, \u201cdoggedness in following a chain of reasoning\u201d). I find the focus on the distribution of sex curious. Maslow\u2019s hierarchy references love and belonging, and though it mentions physical intimacy, it is unclear why these discussions are placing such primacy on sex. It\u2019s probably worth considering the evolutionary function of involuntary male celibacy.  Is it possible that much of the military success of the Muslim expansion, I think, came from the Koranic prescription permitting multiple wives for the wealthy.  This left a large pool of angry young men willing to go to war for the chance of sex.  The genomic data suggests a similar engine behind dramatic population expansions like the Indo-European conquest of Asia. [\u2026] is my 2004 paper with Robin, if you need the background, or try this recent Scott Aaronson post.\u00a0 Recently I was sent a question somewhat along these [\u2026] I\u2019ve given this whole thing some thought, and come to the following conclusions: 1.  I entirely agree that the best thing we can do is to keep practicing compassion and expanding our circle of humanity outwards.  I do think though that we also need to consider something further, namely\u2026 2.  The System-Substance distinction.  This is something that hit me like a ton of bricks when I was pondering why worthy causes tended to fill up with awful people over time.  Basically, it doesn\u2019t matter what system you devise, it will not change the fundamental composition of humanity.  That composition is diverse: some people are smarter than others, some people are braver, some are more compassionate \u2013 and some percentage of all people in all times and all places are nasty, vindictive, narcissistic power-hungry sadists.  You know the Gary Larson cartoon where God adds jerks to Earth \u2018just to make it interesting\u2019?  They\u2019re here and we\u2019re stuck with \u2019em.   https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/322711129527236343\/?autologin=true  There is nothing one can do about it.  One can\u2019t change that these people seek to cause hurt and suffering, one can only try to limit their capacity to do so. Basically, born under different stars Ellen Pao would have been writing Dear Tech companies: you hire an awful lot of Jews.  What are you going to do about it?  The same way that, born in my Grandfather\u2019s time, Anita Sarkeesian would have been partnering with Julius Streicher to talk about how degenerate and, cough cough, cosmopolitan video games  are, the same way that Arthur Chu would have been shouting for the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, the way that Amanda Marcotte would have been fretting that her white womanhood was threated by dangerous knee-grows\u2026   My point is that this is one of the great unsung victories of liberalism for which we should be profoundly grateful for.  Not just that liberalism freed the innocent from persecution, but that it has profoundly limited the damage that the vicious and the wicked can do.  As awful as many of these people are, they aren\u2019t sending the Gestapo or the Stasi to our doors. (for people who hate political correctness, I agree with you, but the version of p.c. we have now ain\u2019t nuttin\u2019 on what my parents and grandparents had to deal with).   In a truly bizarre way, this lead me to be reconciled to feminism.  Many people are anti-feminism because they see the kind of vicious twerps it attracts.  What I realized is, to paraphrase Waugh, can you imagine how terrible they\u2019d be if they weren\u2019t feminists?  https:\/\/www.skepticink.com\/prussian\/2015\/04\/08\/i-find-myself-reconciled-to-feminism\/   So we expand our circle of compassion, try to be decent people as best we can, and accept that a certain portion of humanity is always going to be irredeemably dreadful, but is outnumbered by those that are decent, or at least have the capacity to be so. . arbitrary value #115: I mean, if you\u2019re in the trap where you believe that the doctrine of \u201clived experience\u201d means you have to take into account basically any random shit anyone self-described feminist on the internet says, the answer to how much does it affect you is, quite a bit.  The concern here isn\u2019t so much that it makes you feel bad but that it drives you to put needless restrictions on yourself. Scott #100: My intent with the Commandment, rather, was that scrupulosity-afflicted male nerds should morally fortify themselves, that they should do the daily \u201cspiritual work\u201d of recommitting to being kind and decent people in the above sense, even if the universe is fundamentally capricious and unjust, and even if the nerds will spend their lives being lectured on their feminist failings by men who, in practice, are a thousandth as feminist as they. This is difficult, and it\u2019s necessary. It\u2019s a categorical imperative. Yes, I can\u2019t disagree with that! One remaining disagreement: while you almost had me convinced that we should focus on the general problems of nerdish scrupulosity, and overliteral interpretation of rules, rather than romantic and sexual frustration in particular, the following gave me serious pause. Like, let me put it this way \u2014 I finally made it out of this trap several years ago. Has this led to an increase in romantic or sexual success? Well, um\u2026 no, it hasn\u2019t. But you know what? That\u2019s not really important. What\u2019s important is that this is no longer an area of life that I\u2019m afraid to think clearly about and have to doublethink around. So now that you think so much more clearly about it: what, in your view, are the remaining obstacles in your way? Because whatever those obstacles are, they seem to me like they should also be part of the conversation. I don\u2019t agree.  In fact you\u2019ll notice I didn\u2019t speak of \u201cfrustration\u201d on my part or \u201cobstacles\u201d at all.  And to be clear it\u2019s not just that, like, I can think about this now, it\u2019s that I can actually act.  To be honest, I somewhat resent the implication that I need external help. Basically, the reason I found the previous situation so intolerable is \u2014 well, several things.  One is that, as you\u2019ve mentioned, it seemed that I was being punished for being virtuous.  The other, once I started to make it out of the trap, was the recognition of how unnecessary it all was.  That is to say \u2014 this state of affairs wasn\u2019t just an unfortunate side-effect of people acting in good faith, you know?  It was the result of people bullying others into submission and then telling them untruths. (Now one might say here, oh, but they were still doing it with the best of intentions!  To which I reply, OK, maybe I didn\u2019t phrase my objection exactly right, but my basic point still stands.  There are certain lines one does not cross because the results are predictably disastrous and once you do so I no longer care about your motive.  A person who cuts off negative feedback and refuses to listen to objectors (or worse, punishes them), who tries to shut down arguments rather than engaging with them, who deliberately makes things more tribal instead of less and discussion worse instead of better, does not my criteria for \u201cacting in good faith\u201d, no matter how what their intentions may be.) That is to say, I single out this problem because it is an externally-induced problem, it is a bad thing that people are doing to other people, and in discussing it I had once hoped I could convince people it is something they should stop doing. But this more general problem you discuss, to the extent that it is a problem\u2026 I mean, eh.  That\u2019s just life, you know?  That is to say, when I was in the trap, it felt fundamentally unfair, for both the reasons I\u2019ve mentioned above.  But now I\u2019m playing the same game as everyone else, basically, you know?  If I fail, I fail on my own merits.  (Or just due to chance, but that\u2019s unavoidable.)  That\u2019s something I can accept. Especially because \u2014 well, let me put it this way.  Even with the original broader meaning, one reason I would never adopt the label \u201cincel\u201d is because \u201cinvoluntary\u201d is a very strong word, you know?  Am I really doing everything I can here?  No, of course not.  I have other priorities.  I make the tradeoffs I choose and I accept the consequences.  What exactly is the problem? I also suspect you\u2019ve misapprehended my personal situation\u2026 which is arguably my own fault as \u2014 for obvious reasons! \u2014 I haven\u2019t described it very precisely here.  But, without going into much more detail, it seems that really largely what\u2019s happened as just been a change in contexts.  If somehow we could go back in time and impart my current understanding to myself-as-of-2009, or better yet, myself-as-of-2005 (any further back and I think the difference in viewpoint is not bridgeable \ud83d\ude1b ), the events of the years since then could have played out very differently for me.  But for whatever reason those sorts of opportunities haven\u2019t really cropped up so much now that I am better equipped to handle them.  So, in short, <shrug>. Scott #95, Jesus does warn of judgement against those who refuse to feed the hungry, or to welcome foreigners, for example.  But He also offers forgiveness.  And while He doesn\u2019t ask people to earn this forgiveness through an above-average moral life, there is something He asks of those who are forgiven: that they forgive others.  This can be much more demanding than living an above-average moral life, particularly (I imagine) for people who have suffered a great deal of injustice, or people who belong to a group that\u2019s been persecuted by improbably many regimes over thousands of years, but some people do it anyway. Another thing that comes to mind is this interesting take on Jonah, as does your willingness to offer Arthur Chu a place in your utopia. Also, Paul talks of rewards in the afterlife for what we do in this life, but he makes it clear that the afterlife itself is not one of those rewards. And, in response to some later comments:  I\u2019ve already given my take on the existence of suffering and evil. One additional note I just remembered: I don\u2019t like the term \u201clove-shy\u201d.  Based on what I\u2019ve read, it seems like it\u2019s describing something different. I started reading this as part of a surfing diversion. Wow! I was not aware of the plot twists that were coming up in the story (eg, about the attacks on Hanson) or how long your post was going to be. It was a fascinating read, and I appreciate the clarity with which you call out fallacies. Someone I\u2019m heavily entangled with (where the cost of reversing would be high) routinely makes false equivalences and plays games like motte-and-bailey, though in a completely different context than the subject of your post. Reading your post helps me see that I\u2019m not crazy. Thanks for writing it. Michael #142: I don\u2019t think we\u2019re really disagreeing here.  What you describe is definitely a big part of the problem.  If I\u2019ve neglected to make that clear, it\u2019s only because this has been discussed enough before that I wanted to just outline the problem rather than taking the time to describe it in detail. arbitrary value #115: It sounds like you and I are very different people; I envy your resilience. For whatever reason, when people say nasty things about me online\u2014on Twitter, Facebook, SneerClub, doesn\u2019t matter\u2014it affects me enormously, and (as my wife will testify) is practically the only thing I can think about for days.  Well anyway, when left-wing people do it.  I don\u2019t fully understand why, but when the right-wingers attack me with equal vehemence, I don\u2019t particularly care, or even treat it as funny and a badge of honor. \ud83d\ude42  Among right-wingers, only Lubos once had the ability to get under my skin, and not even he does any more. But with the left-wing voices of \u201csane, mainstream  respectability\u201d?  Even when they\u2019re just attacking nerds in general, not me in particular, it can still easily ruin my day.  But I also can\u2019t stop myself from looking. I wish I could change this aspect of myself, but it feels so deeply ingrained that, if you tried to excise whatever parts of my character were responsible for it, I\u2019d be left a vegetable. Sniffnoy, Nice post. Check out Siderea\u2019s The Asshole Filter: https:\/\/siderea.livejournal.com\/1230660.html \u201cAn asshole filter happens when one has set of norms which results in one primarily, or at least disproportionately, coming into contact with assholes.\u201d A set of overly restrictive feminist rules will only filter out the rule-followers, resulting in women having to deal with a lot of assholes who don\u2019t care about the rules. That\u2019s bad for men but especially bad for women. With regard to the exponential discounting of the future cost of eg. global warming, I suppose you\u2019re familiar with https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hyperbolic_discounting ?  There is probably a connection to a favourite of yours, the concept of Knightian uncertainty, in the sense that the longer to the future we try to estimate the risks, the less reliable our risk estimate is. And the model for the risk of losing the whole capital is essential when trying to discount over truly long periods of time. Anon Commenter #145: Scott mentions that incels are denied from the third level of Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs (love and belonging) but it\u2019s even worse than that; sex is actually in the very first level, i.e., the same level as *air*.  It seems weird at first, but it doesn\u2019t matter to your genes if you\u2019re not able to reproduce due to a lack of air or a lack of sex, so it makes sense that motivation for seeking sex is one of the most fundamental forms of motivation that we have, as Maslow observed. It agrees with my personal life as well: I was a \u201cmoderate incel\u201d for over a decade and the motivation to escape celibacy was what kept me going when things seemed hopeless. Hi Scott, Perhaps what Hanson is trying to say is that income redistribution, which is done by violating the eight commandment (\u201cYou shall not steal\u201d), is just as immoral? ScentOfViolets #132: As a warning, I find that your comment was not \u201cwritten in a spirit of kindness and mutual respect\u201d; any further comments that engage in nasty stereotypes or attack people\u2019s intelligence will be banned. Just as an empirical point, with no normative judgments attached, inequalities of romantic success appear to be staggering.  Among the few people I\u2019ve met and had occasion to discuss these matters with, reported number of sexual partners ranges from zero all the way up to hundreds.  It would be interesting if some enterprising reader wanted to calculate a \u201cGini coefficient\u201d for this (using GSS data or whatever), and compare to the Gini coefficient for wealth. If your grad school colleague was really as slovenly, overweight, and odoriferous as you say, then how on earth could you \u201cguarantee\u201d that he could go home with someone after one night out at a bar?  Do our friends, the social-justice feminists, know about this \u201cguarantee\u201d that you made to him, and its possible ominous implications for consent?? Also, if I can trade anecdote for anecdote: I know guys in CS who are not only brilliant but kind, physically fit, and (I think\u2026) attractive, yet who\u2019ve gone decades without dating anybody, simply because\u2014as far as I can tell\u2014even on the very rare occasions where they\u2019d be socializing with single women, they\u2019ve internalized polite social norms that prevent them from making any sort of move, norms that I understand all too well. Elephant #137: It seems absurd to say that inequality of wealth is \u201cequal\u201d to inequality of romantic and sexual success\u2014indeed, among my own circle of acquaintances, I\u2019ve observed no correlation whatsoever between the two. The regulators, with their risk weighted capital requirements for banks, hold that what is perceived as risky is more dangerous to the bank system than what is perceived as safe. I argue that what is perceived as safe has more dangerous fatter tail risks, and poses therefore much more significant danger to the stability of our bank system.  I would be grateful if you, with the agreement theorem in mind, could advice me on what to when the other party does not want to discuss the disagreement. http:\/\/perkurowski.blogspot.com\/2016\/04\/here-are-17-reasons-for-why-i-believe.html Rand #139: There\u2019s no question that the extreme gender imbalances in CS and other STEM fields play a role in what we\u2019re talking about. (In my case, the issue was even more extreme, since I skipped most of high school, so thereafter most of the women I met were either years older than me and saw me as a little kid, or else years younger academically and saw me as a geezer.  Do you have any idea how few women there are in theoretical computer science who were also born in the early 1980s and finished college at 17 or 18?  As it happens, I\u2019m only aware of one \u2026 namely, the one I married. \ud83d\ude00 ) In any case, though, while gender imbalances are part of the issue, they can\u2019t possibly be all of it.  E.g., even before I\u2019d skipped any grades, and before I\u2019d immersed myself in the world of academic CS, I was already bullied and a nerdy outcast\u2014which, indeed, was a large part of the rationale for jumping right into college and research, the thought that socially things could hardly be worse than they already were. But looking more broadly: American football players, in the NFL, college, and high school, have an even more extreme gender imbalance than CS does, with approximately 100 men for every 0 women.  Yet somehow, that population isn\u2019t known for its difficulties finding partners. There do exist \u201cscience groupies\u201d (I\u2019ve met some)\u2014i.e., people who are not scientists, yet serially and preferentially date them\u2014but not many, I\u2019d guess maybe 1 or 2 for every hundred scientists.  Why?  As Amia Srinivasan might ask, why not \u201ccritically interrogate\u201d these interesting phenomena, rather than shrugging them off as brute features of reality? Bram #140: Imagine there was a population where everyone had to spend 15 years in prison for no reason\u2014after which they were released, and most went on to live happy and successful lives (though some were permanently scarred).  Wouldn\u2019t you feel still compassion for these people while they were in the prison?  I would! There\u2019s also an economic puzzle at the heart of your observation.  If there were a set of stocks, most of which everyone knew would shoot up in value by a decade from now, then why haven\u2019t they shot up in value already?  Similarly, if there were a population of single, nerdy 20-year-olds, most of whom people knew would be successful at life and desirable romantic partners 10-15 years from now, then why wouldn\u2019t there be any rush to lock them down today?  Like, I can think of about five possible answers to this question, but I\u2019m not sure which if any to believe; something doesn\u2019t add up. Alan Hardy #144: All the differences you note between Srinivasan\u2019s and Hanson\u2019s presentation styles are ones that I noted myself\u2014and while I didn\u2019t explicitly point out the difference in their academic backgrounds (one\u2019s a philosopher, the other\u2019s an economist), I\u2019m happy to do so now.  But then I explicitly said that I wanted to move past all these superficial differences\u2014important though they might be to explaining the wildly differing reactions\u2014and ask what differences might remain in the substance of the respective arguments. Alcoholics Anonymous suggests (in the same way, it\u2019s often said, that it is \u201csuggested\u201d one use a parachute when skydiving) to its members that have achieved some semblance of recovery from their former state, that they pay for their seat through helping the next alcoholic. Unfortunately, it seems recovery from incelism is a particularly difficult condition to get even former sufferers to remember the pain of with the kind of urgency one feels in the depths of despair. We have lone figures like the bloggers Scott who write thoughtful solidarity essays but even the professional psychiatrist seems more interested in generalized depression and the metaphysics of disagreement (dear lord guys) than finding out what exactly this culture destabilizing neurosis is and how it can best be addressed. Am I suggesting just because some people, by luck or will or grace, manage to get past their issue should set aside their true calling (be it quantum computing or whatever), just to double back and try to help the quite possibly hopeless loser that will likely make no significant contribution to physics\/mathematics\/humankind\u2019s great intellectual edifice? Duh. That is literally exactly what I am suggesting. What could be more important? Anon Commenter #145: Please check my comment #34.  To recap, I think it\u2019s absolutely right that sex is merely one part of a package that includes love, belonging, romance, emotional support, acceptance, and validation\u2014but for most people (or certainly most men), it\u2019s an inextricable part, and also the one with the most objective answer as to whether someone has it or they don\u2019t.  Or to put it differently: yes, love and emotional intimacy are \u201chigher\u201d aspirations than mere sex.  But if someone won\u2019t have sex with you, whereas she will have sex with others, then the chances that she genuinely romantically loves you aren\u2019t great. This seems to me like such a complete resolution of this particular puzzle, that I\u2019m honestly confused as to why people keep getting into interminable arguments about it whenever the subject of love-shys comes up\u2026 \ud83d\ude42 Scott, I apologise for this enormous tangent from your original post. But your comment (#114) to Gatekeepers about God and the Holocaust reminded of something that I\u2019ve often thought about\u2013albeit, it is the kind of odd thought that most people would probably say is crazy. (And I hope I do not offend you, or make you as crazy as I am, by sharing it.) From my knowledge of my family history, it seems very likely that were it not for Nazi Germany (and all the horrors that wicked regime unleashed on the world) my parents would probably have grown up in different countries and never met, if they had even been born at all. I know nothing of your family history, but similar facts may well be true for you. I am so glad that my children, whom I love and adore, exist. But, in a universe in which the evils of Nazism never happened, almost certainly I would never have been born, and hence they would never have been born either. If I am glad that my children exist, then should I not also be glad for everything necessary to their existence? But what if the Holocaust is necessary to their existence? Should I then be glad for the Holocaust? Yet, to be glad for the deaths of millions of innocents seems monstrously inhuman. Could it be, that something so innocent and pure, my parental love and happiness at the existence of my children, logically entails something so horrid and monstrous as being glad for the Holocaust? There is nothing necessarily theistic about this thought\u2013indeed, I got the idea from Nietzsche. On the other hand, if there is a God, maybe he has to choose between a universe in which my children exist and millions of innocents suffer and die, and one in which those millions live in peace and my children are never born\u2013and maybe he chooses the first. Maybe he loves my children so much, he is willing to murder millions of innocents if that is what is necessary for my children to exist. (Maybe I love them that much?) And maybe if that is true, maybe then he is a wicked God\u2013but then who am I to complain, if the desires of my heart are as wicked as his? Sniffnoy #149: If you resent the implication that you need external help, then I guess we should both be happy that I never offered any! \ud83d\ude42  I was trying to focus not on you in particular, but on the broader question of what obstacles stand between nerds and romantic fulfillment.  If and when our culture ever advances to the point where we can have honest and compassionate conversations about these matters, I\u2019d like the outcome to be, not that the hundreds of people who told me their heartbreaking stories during the comment-171 affair are taught to accept their current condition stoically and with philosophical clarity, but rather that they\u2019re taught whatever is needed actually to get into romantic relationships. Anonymous #160: Dude, I\u2019m doing what I can here, \ud83d\ude42 even though the considerable time I\u2019ve spent on this issue earns me zero credit or even negative credit in the wider culture.  I completely agree that there needs to be more mainstream support\u2014at the very least, therapists and psychologists willing to look the problem in the eye and call it what it is\u2014so that there\u2019d be less need for lone voices in the wilderness like me and Scott Alexander. Simon #162: Indeed, if not for Hitler, my grandfather would not have been clearing mines for the US Army during WWII, so the whole trajectory of his life would\u2019ve been different, so he almost certainly would never have met my grandmother, so I would not exist. But one can say that about any historical event.  If Babe Ruth had hit an additional home run, some chaotic butterfly-effect something-or-other would likewise have led to my never being born.  There\u2019s nothing specific here about evil events. And how much cosmic importance does one\u2019s own existence have anyway?  It seems to me that one should still wish the evil events never happened, even if it would mean one was never born. Scott #164: You\u2019ve done more than most by miles, granted. Whether or not that\u2019s enough is of course for you to decide, but either way I would urge you not to take the easy comfort of pawning the problem off on therapists. The answer will not be found by them. Take it from someone that has worked with dozens. You wanna know what the majority of therapists are like? Check back in with the Twitter mob. The same people that go through life with the easy, unconscious certainty that they know what\u2019s wrong with Robin Hanson have the same easy, unconscious certainty that they know what\u2019s wrong with everybody. With so many of these people out there it\u2019s a wonder there are any problems left in the world at all. Sorry to be such a downer but when even the guys representing the losers all have wives and two kids, I think maybe it\u2019s not such a bad thing to have some noises made by the unhappy anonymous subject of discussion. Anyway I do thank you for the part you play. Hopefully one day I\u2019ll have something more to contribute and you\u2019ll have one more voice alongside you. What about the bodily autonomy of men? (for an example, watch \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d) Scott, I wholeheartedly agree with 98% of this post, especially that we should take universal compassion and respect for bodily autonomy as our foundational moral principles. I\u2019m even okay with singling out women in your zeroth commandment, for various reasons. And I heartily endorse, also following the moral teachings of Jesus, extending this compassion to include our \u201cenemies\u201d, whether they be SJWs, alt-righters, feminists, racists, hate-mongers, bullies, radical terrorists (incel, muslim, right-wing, or left-wing), our political opponents, etc. However, this being the internet, I hope you\u2019ll forgive me if I bring up the 2% I disagree with. I don\u2019t think that Robin Hanson did anything wrong, or should not have said what he said. Robin Hanson is a provocative thinker and public intellectual. He is provocative in the best sense \u2014 he provokes not for attention or to sow chaos, but to cause us to examine our assumptions. I think that such people play a vital role in our public debate. Indeed, I would even say that our ability to tolerate and indeed encourage thinkers such as Robin, even (or especially) when they write things such as he wrote, is absolutely essential to a healthy public discourse. Would that we had a thousand Robin Hansons! I know that you have written about self-censorship here before (though ironically, in the process, not censoring yourself!). But I think this we should not do. We must fight for a world of open dialogue and respect for nerds. But while we live in this society, which admittedly is pretty open and free in many respects, those who can should speak up. Yes, this will invite a certain degree of scorn and ridicule on us nerds. But in a sense, speaking in this fashion is part of the service that nerds do for society. For what is more quintessentially nerdy than to point out a logical inconsistency in the reasoning of society, by comparing things that normal people simply do not think to compare because doing so is taboo? But this is precisely how societies advance. And this is one of the greatest services that nerds fulfill. (Okay, the science, math, and tech are pretty useful too! Though this advancement is pretty difficult to disentangle from the property of nerds I\u2019m pointing to here.) So in short, if your point in this post was something like, \u201cFor the love of God, fellow nerds, resist your impulse to make comparisons between sex and money. Yes, this taboo is illogical, but doing so will not change anyone\u2019s mind and will only invite scorn upon us!\u201d  then I have to strongly disagree. (Incidentally, the Scott Alexander post makes exactly this comparison). But then I\u2019m an economist, so I would say this, wouldn\u2019t I \ud83d\ude09 Scott #165: If some great historical evil is necessary for my children\u2019s existence, how can I wish that evil never happened and love my children at the same time? For to wish that evil never happened is to wish that my children never existed. I am saying I prefer the possible world, in which that evil never happened, to this actual world in which it did; but that means I prefer the possible world, in which my children don\u2019t exist, to the actual world in which they do. My love for my children tells me I should value possible worlds in which they exist over possible worlds in which they don\u2019t. This is true whether the historical event necessary to their existence is good or evil or morally neutral. But, I don\u2019t feel any moral imperative to wish that good or neutral events happened differently; I do feel a moral imperative to wish that evil events happened differently \u2013 and the more evil the event, the greater that imperative \u2013 but that moral imperative conflicts with my love for my children. Scott #165 \u201cIf Babe Ruth had hit an additional home run, some chaotic butterfly-effect something-or-other would likewise have led to my never being born.\u201d But what do we really mean by \u201cif\u201d? Aren\u2019t the only physically coherent \u201cif\u201d scenarios the ones where the various outcomes are the result of quantum randomness (they each correspond to an actual branch of the multiverse)?\nMost what-if scenarios are just not feasible because altering one thing would require everything else to be different. E.g. you\u2019d have to go back quite far in time to find a quantum randomness which influences the start and outcome of WW2, but then everything else would probably be vastly different too. But maybe I\u2019m wrong about this\u2026 QM always gives a non-zero probability to any imaginary scenario, even something like \u201cScott\u2019s brain spontaneously rewired itself so that he now knows Chinese instead of English\u201d? The other interesting thing is that physical processes like human brains have patterns in them that are somewhat robust to (local) quantum jitter \u2013 e.g. all the IBM PCs can run the same C program in exactly the same way, regardless of vast differences at their atomic level. I also heard theories about cosmological versions of this \u2013 an infinite universe means that any imaginary scenario will happen somewhere. I guess it\u2019s the equivalent of saying that you can find any piece of information in the digits of the number PI, assuming you look long enough. I think this entire discussion tends to overlook system-level, utilitarian tradeoffs in terms of crime prevention, socialization efficiency, cultural drive and motivation in males, as well as vulnerability to parasites and the expected damage they may cause. If you admit more freedom and status to men, they will more likely exploit their power and can more freely exert violence, sometimes to the disadvantage of women. But this has probably been overstated by feminists because (1) cruelty is naturally frowned upon, (2) women often have rape fantasies and (3) women do not report increased life satisfaction since the 1960s (~20-40 years after women\u2019s suffrage and misogynist pseudomedicine). If you admit more freedom and status to women, on the other hand, they will more likely exploit the fact that men have a higher sex drive (in fact, every fourth male thinks much more often about sex than any woman). Hence, a perfectly egalitarian society with respect to sexual and economic freedom would favor women because women can easily steer men around by mere pretense of sexual willingness. At the same time, you also decrease the status of men relative to women so fewer males can achieve the confidence needed to impress a woman and are thus less motivated to align themselves with the system by family formation and producing offspring. Disadvantaged men are much more dangerous than disadvantaged women, especially since men are more aggressive and women score higher in trait agreeableness, so they are more likely content with subordinate roles.  The optimal solution regarding the relative social status of the sexes is certainly not the 1930s, but also not the 2010s. It is probably close to state of the 1960s. The ever increasing number of members of forums like \/r\/MGTOW, seems to provide evidence that feminism has simply gone too far. Egalitarianism is essential at the inter-communal level as it ensures decentralization of power. Feminists kind of piggybacked on this idea and applied it to gender differences without thinking through all the implications. jonathan #168: Thanks for that beautiful comment. My point was something like: one needs to take account of where the culture currently is, in figuring out which widely-accepted inconsistencies it makes any sense to challenge, and which challenges will only outrage people (even otherwise very reasonable and intelligent people), entrench them further in their existing views, and bring volcanic denunciation down on your head, as everyone pattern-matches whatever you said (and whatever you will say in the future) to a genuine great evil.  And furthermore: as I said in the post, often one needs to make an emotional appeal, about a particular form of suffering being bad or deserving compassion at all, before one can even get started discussing how to alleviate it, how it compares to other forms of suffering, etc.  I speak from experience in these matters. \ud83d\ude42 Simon #169: Well, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to resolve one of the great imponderables of philosophy and literature in a blog comment thread. \ud83d\ude42  It\u2019s easy to invent examples, like: Alice\u2019s true burning love since childhood has been Bob.  On their wedding day, however, Bob fails to show up\u2014and Alice is told that it\u2019s because Bob ran off with another woman to a faraway country.  Alice is devastated and considers suicide \u2026 but a year later she settles down with Charlie, who she likes well enough.  Together, Alice and Charlie raise three children who they love very much. Twenty years later, Alice finds Bob on Facebook.  It turns out that Bob never ran off with the other woman at all, but was kidnapped!  A year later, Bob escaped his kidnapper, and was heartbroken to learn on asking around that Alice was now married to Charlie.  But Bob made the fateful decision not to contact Alice, because he didn\u2019t want to disrupt Alice\u2019s new life. So, question: does Alice now regret having married Charlie\u2014even though that means regretting the existence of her three beloved children? At a high level, perhaps the only thing to say about such a question is that, if you were to write this as a novel, you\u2019d need to devote a lot of space both to Alice\u2019s regretting her choice, and to her feeling guilty about her regret. fred #170: It would be child\u2019s-play to construct a scenario wherein a quantum fluctuation causes a neuron to fire in Babe Ruth\u2019s brain, which then triggers a cascade of other neurons firing, which then causes him to hit a home run. (Though there are lots of interesting open questions here, for example about the timescale over which such a scenario would play out.  For some of my own thoughts, see The Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine.) Scott #154: Just as an empirical point, with no normative judgments attached, inequalities of romantic success appear to be staggering. Hands up: how many people truly believe the problem of inequalities of romantic success are on a par with the problems of inequalities of wealth. Now to those with your hands up what evidence do you have for this belief? Not feelings, not personal testimonials, evidence on a par with the evidence of why wealth inequality is a very bad thing indeed. Believe it or not, one of the early Soviet decrees \u201cnationalized\u201d women in 1918. Because, you know, it\u2019s unfair that clean well-spoken bourgeois get all the women, and workers and peasants don\u2019t. So the idea did indeed cross the mind of redistribution loving leftist thugs. In Russian: https:\/\/beloedelo-spb.livejournal.com\/312961.html Still wondering why no one has reacted with outrage at the idea of having compassion for Adam Lanza, Donald Trump, etc. Maybe people here are not as addicted to the righteous anger\u2026 Sniffnoy #93: Do you (or does any other commenter) know of a general recipe for finding other examples of the trap? Just brainstorming examples could leave out social norms that I\u2019ve already thoroughly internalized, and I\u2019m also not confident in my inferences about how other people feel in some of these situations. Scott #96: Rather than \u201clove-shy\u201d (which to me sounds kind of like aromantic), how about \u201cinvoluntarily celibate people\u201d, to remind people of the literal meaning of \u201cincel\u201d and help counteract the motte-and-bailey tactic? #131, legalizing prostitution would help some people and should be done out of principle. But I do not think it would be as useful as you might hope. My own experience suggests that if prostitution can help people who are just horny, it does not help much if you are lonely. It can even be counterproductive. ScentofViolets, Which would you rather be: broke for the rest of your life, or alone for the rest of your life? The way we prepare young people for real work life has a lot to criticize, but at least our education system acknowledges that preparing kids to make money is important. The way we prepare young people for real life relationships is barbaric. We throw them in a cauldron of other young people for 12 years and hope they figure it out from pop-culture and a sliver of abstinence based sex-ed. If the kids don\u2019t succeed that is considered a GOOD outcome since it lowers teen sex activity rates. Aldous Huxley\u2019s 1962 novel \u201cIsland\u201d addressed a lot of this, featuring a society where teenagers were taught how to have relationships and to make love by sex surrogates. I suppose today the left and right would have had Huxley drawn and quartered for suggesting that. CS Grad Student, I have a comment related to that awaiting moderation, it had profanity from the title of the linked essay so that\u2019s probably why.  Here\u2019s the essay, by Siderea that describes similar kind of traps, but from the perspective of the one creating the norms: https:\/\/siderea.livejournal.com\/1230660.html The idea is that when you create norm\/rule\/boundary and then don\u2019t enforce it properly, it rewards transgressive individuals and punishes rule-followers. The example in the article is from workplace communication not relationships. Not sure if this was mentioned yet, but the apparent coiner of the term incel agrees that we should move on from the word: https:\/\/www.politico.com\/magazine\/story\/2018\/05\/08\/intel-involuntary-celibate-movement-218324 Daniel #131: My view (see #34 and #162), that sex is merely one inextricable part of a package that includes deeper human needs like validation of self-worth, romantic love, and affection, strongly predicts that legalizing prostitution would not by itself solve the problem we\u2019re talking about.  On the other hand, sure, it could probably help improve the attitudes of some male virgins, by at least making intimate contact with women seem less cosmically unattainable, like a quantum theory of gravity or a proof of P\u2260NP, and more human and ordinary.  (Prostitution helping to instill feminist values \u2026 imagine that.)  For that and many other reasons\u2014including protecting the safety and welfare of sex workers\u2014I like many others am strongly in favor of legalizing prostitution.  And I see no reason why the sex-positive feminists who\u2019ve long been advocating that cause on behalf of sex workers, shouldn\u2019t be able to use the additional argument that it could have a therapeutic value for certain populations of men.  It would be as if the advocates of legalized marijuana needed to concede at the outset that marijuana was always and everywhere evil, and merely argue that criminalizing it made matters even worse, rather than pointing out the large benefits that marijuana can confer on chronic pain sufferers. Tungsten #154: Yes I\u2019ve read that essay and also recommend it! \ud83d\ude42 ScentOfViolets #176: Not getting into an argument on the merits here (I don\u2019t share either your or Scott\u2019s position here), but I think I\u2019ve spotted what may be a miscommunication here.  Scott\u2019s comment, that you\u2019re replying to, was about the level of inequality.  Your reply was about the extent to which inequality should be by itself be regarded as a problem in the first place.  These are different questions! ScentOfViolets #176: We were talking here only about the statistics of number of sexual partners, not about whether any inequality that might exist along such dimensions is a \u201cproblem.\u201d  Just because something is distributed inequally, that doesn\u2019t automatically mean it\u2019s a problem\u2014in Enlightenment Now, for example, Steven Pinker advances a detailed argument that, while poverty is a huge problem, wealth inequality per se is not, and we should support things like free trade that reduce poverty even if they increase inequality at the same time.  If inequality along some dimension is a problem, then that\u2019s a claim that needs to be defended separately, using moral considerations rather than just data-gathering. On the factual question, a minute of googling turned up a page that does calculate Gini coefficients for numbers of sexual partners per year.  The coefficients it gets are .536 for straight single men and .470 for straight single women, comparable to the before-tax Gini coefficients of some of the most unequal countries on earth, like Botswana and Haiti (see here for a table).  Of course, one feature of the data that would complicate a \u201credpill\u201d narrative is that the Gini coefficient for men is only modestly higher than the one for women. Tungsten #181: I haven\u2019t read Island by Aldous Huxley, but I did once read The Harrad Experiment, a 1960s novel about a college that tries to teach its students to form healthy relationships, by assigning roommates that it thinks would make good sex partners.  I found it quite poor as literature, but here\u2019s what\u2019s interesting about it: in the 60s and 70s, it was apparently considered a left-wing, subversive, pro-free-love novel, and was extremely popular among hippies.  Were it published today, the SJWs would surely condemn it as hate literature and boycott the publisher. Scott #184: I did not ask for a calculation  of some gini-like coefficient; I asked which was the more important problem to address. This goes to the heart of Hanson\u2019s question about the \u2018leftist \u2018 apparent lack of concern for people who are involuntarily celibate. If the answer is \u2018because they think that this problem is pretty small potatoes compared to other problems they care about\u2019 well, the question is pretty much answered, in fact, answered just as soon as you finish asking it. So I ask you again: if you think involuntarily  celibacy is the more pressing problem, what evidence do you have for this? ScentOfViolets #192: There\u2019s no need whatsoever to prove that A is a more important problem than B, in order to also worry about A.  Or even to worry exclusively about A\u2014if (for example) one feels that B is already getting a lot of attention, or if A happens to be one\u2019s particular area of interest. Furthermore, this is completely obvious.  The only reason to impose the \u201cisolated demand for rigor\u201d (in Scott Alexander\u2019s phrase), that people prove that A is a bigger problem than B before they can discuss A\u2014when that wasn\u2019t a claim that any party to the conversation had made\u2014is to sneer at people for trying to discuss A. It\u2019s true that, if A was a totally insignificant problem, then it would be bizarre to ask (as Hanson did) why people don\u2019t worry about A even though they worry about B.  Obviously, I personally don\u2019t feel that life-crippling, often suicidal loneliness on the part of millions of people is an insignificant problem.  But more importantly, in this post I wasn\u2019t defending Hanson\u2019s choice to compare A and B.  In fact, I explicitly wrote that he should never have made the comparison and that I wish he\u2019d apologize for it, because of its potential to offend people. Even after a warning, I unfortunately find that you\u2019re not participating in good faith, so you\u2019re banned from further comments on this thread. (Resubmitting because I messed up) I think there is a certain sort of entitlement involved when people think about romantic\/sexual relationships. For example, in the case of money it is generally understood that people will either inherit their wealth or they will have to put a significant amount of effort into acquiring it. Even if they do, they are not guaranteed to succeed. It seems to me that many people (especially ones from the \u201cnerd camp\u201d which I consider myself to be a part of) do not appreciate that, especially for someone who is not particularly attractive, it can take a decent amount of effort to understand how these relationships work and how diverse they can be.** Although I would say that even attractiveness can be improved considerably with simple lifestyle adjustments such as having healthy diet, working out, paying more attention to socially acceptable clothing choices\u2026 In fact I\u2019ll go out on a limb and say (in usual online armchair psychologist fashion) that nerdy people tend to appreciate rules and structure more than the average person when it comes to understanding the world around them. I think this makes them susceptible to having a black-and-white view of real life situations. This also aligns with what Sniffnoy said about \u201cthe trap\u201d. It\u2019s easier for nerds to think in terms of absolutes instead of just probabilistic educated guesses because it satisfies their need to make decisions in a principled and structured way.\nA classic example is \u201cwomen love confidence\u201d. We can all agree that misplaced confidence can kill someone\u2019s charisma and make them look like an idiot in front of both men and women (unless they\u2019re running for president :>). Furthermore, there are cases where being honest with your uncertainty and lack of confidence when you address someone\u2019s concerns may make you more relatable and approachable to that person. However, it\u2019s much easier to believe the simple 3 word rule than to start digging and considering all the possible outcomes in all the different settings that they can occur. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that nerds are undercutting themselves by not using their mind as carefully in social contexts as they do in academic\/intellectual ones. In my experience I haven\u2019t met that many people in all of my years in school\/uni whom I would consider incels (in the literal sense) due to their looks. Maybe I\u2019m too optimistic but for most people who face these issues I genuinely believe there are solutions or at least a decent middle ground they can achieve. It\u2019s just not necessarily easy for everyone and that\u2019s OK because that\u2019s how things often work in virtually all avenues of life. **In general, I would say that someone who is conventionally attractive and socially conforming enough can get away with way less thinking, introspection, and lifestyle\/personality adjustments. Scott, not sure you intended this, but: \u201cOr even to worry exclusively about A\u2014if (for example) one feels that B is already getting a lot of attention, or if A happens to be one\u2019s particular area of interest.\u201d \u2026 could also be used by leftists in response to Hanson if they were even able to parse him. Also, couldn\u2019t one take Hanson to task for requesting an \u201cisolated demand for rigor\u201d in order to sneer at leftists for not worrying about  the suffering of the involuntary celibate? That last question is directed generally and not at Scott as I know he is emphatically not defending Hanson\u2019s comparison. CS Grad Student#183- You might want to consult a psychiatrist. If you have a mental illness of some sort, the same advice that would work on the average person in your situation wouldn\u2019t work for you, so you might want to rule that out. > Still, on the merits, is there any relevant difference between the two cases This seems intellectually dishonest. Surely you know in your heart that the problems faced by a disabled person are not equivalent to those faced by an awkward, but otherwise able person, even if the problem has the same description. That\u2019s like equivocating shooting a sign post with shooting a human. Something got shot, but we don\u2019t have a funeral for both. The \u201cundesirability\u201d of a disabled or horribly disfigured person is usually beyond their control to fix. Meanwhile, in almost all cases that are in the public discourse (those \u201cincels\u201d who turn their frustration into violence), the nerdy white male has the means and the ability to change, but chooses not to. Inequalities are injustices when the losing party has no reasonable escape or fault. I\u2019ve seen no convincing argument that this applies to nerdy white men (and for every argument I\u2019ve seen, I know many counterexamples). Instead, I see men passing around copies of \u201cpick up artist\u201d books, and I wonder why they don\u2019t apply their sheer intellect to see the folly in that? I too grew up a confused nerdy white boy, completely lost about how to interact and have healthy relationships with women. I even read a bunch of that pick up artist literature (recommended by my college RA!) like an idiot. Much later, I deliberately decided to improve, and after many missteps found a partner. I find it very hard to believe that one can grok Cantor\u2019s theorem (and much more) but be totally incapable of learning how to be sociable. I find it hard to believe that the nuance required to understand mathematics does not translate (for those who are willing and spend the time) to the nuance needed to understand and navigate social issues. Sorry to go on a tangent but this appears to me to be incorrect, because it is not fully applying discounted value: I recall in particular a lecture that Robin gave years ago in which he argued\u2014and I apologize to Robin if I mangle a detail, but this was definitely the essence\u2014that even if you grant that anthropogenic climate change will destroy human civilization and most complex ecosystems hundreds of years from now, that\u2019s not necessarily something you should worry about, because if you apply the standard exponential time-discounting that economists apply to everything else, along with reasonable estimates for the monetary value of everything on earth, you discover that all life on earth centuries from now just isn\u2019t worth very much in today\u2019s dollars. The correct comparison would be to compare the discounted value of all future human production, with or without the destruction of human civilization. Not the market value of all assets at the time of the possible destruction of human civilization. Hanson makes a good point that there are different kinds of inequality and we should consider applying ideas from one to another.  However, he is the one who brought up \u201credistribution\u201d and in fact the \u201cimplicit threat of violence\u201d, so those aren\u2019t just words being put into his mouth by uncharitable critics.  His suggestions of applying  the logic of wealth redistribution to sex seem to me (a) being deliberately provocative, and (b) at some level trolling those who believe in wealth redistribution. If you try to rephrase his point in a less offensive way, you realize that it\u2019s not sex that\u2019s the issue, but some combination of loneliness and low status.  (Otherwise the angry incels would go to prostitutes, etc.) And it\u2019s hardly a fringe or novel idea to say that loneliness, social isolation, etc. are important problems in rich countries today. I\u2019m sure some of the criticism was excessive but it seems to me that Hanson was trying to annoy people and succeeded, not that he is just an innocent nerd who can\u2019t quite manage to express himself in a politically correct way. Scott #162:  \nAmerican football players, in the NFL, college, and high school, have an even more extreme gender imbalance than CS does, with approximately 100 men for every 0 women.\n Yes, but the American football community is quite a bit bigger. You\u2019d be surprised how often I see people exclaiming their Eagle\u2019s fandom (some only their Eagles fandom) on dating websites, for all that I try to screen anything related to headbrick. College football too: When the Columbia Lions won whatever they won recently, people were popping up over my Facebook saying \u201cGo Lions!\u201d (Note: I never attended Columbia but to my understanding they\u2019re one of the least sportsy universities in the country.) In \u201cThe Righteous Mind\u201d, Jonathan Haidt talks about UVA football games as being a mass religious experience \u2013 which probably leads to a fair number of UVA relationships.  It\u2019s not just that computer science is heavily male. It\u2019s that computer scientist are unlikely to be members of non-heavily male communities. They\u2019re not church-goers in my experience, though church (and more broadly, religious communal events) is a great place to form relationships. It\u2019s probably hard to have this conversation without mentioning gaming. So: Gaming. Good community builder, really awful gender ratios. This is true of a lot of activities commonly associated with nerds.  Obviously, why these communities have gotten to be this way deserves serious inquiry and corrective measures, if possible. \n(Do you have any idea how few women there are in theoretical computer science who were also born in the early 1980s and finished college at 17 or 18? As it happens, I\u2019m only aware of one \u2026 namely, the one I married. \ud83d\ude00 )\n Probably a better idea than most. Also, I might be able to add a few names, unless you\u2019re one of those bigots who thinks that the type theorists, domain theorists, categorical semanticists etc. aren\u2019t real theoretical computer scientists, in which case I have nothing more to say to you \ud83d\ude09 Scott, Furthermore, this is completely obvious. The only reason to impose the \u201cisolated demand for rigor\u201d (in Scott Alexander\u2019s phrase), that people prove that A is a bigger problem than B before they can discuss A\u2014when that wasn\u2019t a claim that any party to the conversation had made\u2014is to sneer at people for trying to discuss A. A useful mantra I\u2019ve found here is:  Human suffering is an evil to be vanquished, not a competition to be won. \u2018Wouldn\u2019t you feel still compassion for these people while they were in the prison?\u2019 Yes, people would feel compassion for such people because they would think something from the outside forced them into that prison and it could happen to them as well at anytime. In contrast, people being deprived of any sexual contact, people with crippling depressions, people who are obscenely overweight etc. are usually rather thought of being responsible themselves for the situation they are in. This if course is not entirely true, as there indeed are illnesses causing overweight, depression is an illness itself and social disorders are often caused by such. But they are also people with similar \u2018symptoms\u2019 which are at fault themselves or which even make a sport out of being the most depressed\/socially aggrieved, blaming the society instead of self-reflection etc. Hence it might be natural to be cautious with the own compassion in such a situation.  I think your approach of encouragement is exactly the right one: \u2018Here is my story about how I lost a hundred pounds\/overcame depression after a decade of suffering\/managed to have a functional family after being a wizard\u2019 (btw that\u2019s the term my \u2018incel\u2019 friends are not offended to go by) can really be inspiring and make a change for others.  Demanding compassion on the other hand is difficult due to the aforementioned reasons; and the scientific value of compassion is also questionable. At least for overweight and depressed people (and a lot of similar problems), too much compassion is actually hurtful. Often people need to hit rock bottom for a change, while\n being supported by friends, family and the society can motivate to stay in a very unhealthy situation much longer. Real change usually needs to come from within, and it might be different for everyone how to get there.  So maybe speaking in the name of all shy, male nerds is problematic as they seem to be a very very very inhomogeneous group of people. And I would suspect the majority would not like to be even mentioned in the context of sexual predators  as (as said also in several other comments here) because their problem is rather that they are unable to interact with women *at all*. But serving as a good example that one can overcome such hurdles is a role that suits you very well and with which you certainly provide help and hope for many others out there. Jeremy #197: There\u2019s an obvious tension between the type of anti-shy-male-nerd discourse that says their misery needn\u2019t be taken seriously because if they just invested some effort to improve themselves, they\u2019d be perfectly attractive and dateable; and the type that says the problem is their petulant refusal to accept how inherently gross and unattractive they are, and it\u2019s fine if they die alone because only entitled misogynists believe that everyone deserves a partner.  In a typical Twitter thread on this subject, you can find both of these arguments side by side, with no one even remarking on the contradiction between the two.  And yet you accuse me of intellectual dishonesty! This is a warning; please demonstrate more of what I called a \u201cspirit of kindness and mutual respect\u201d or you\u2019re no longer welcome on this thread. aram #199: I did strongly criticize Robin for poking this hornet\u2019s nest, and said I wished he\u2019d apologize (or at least, show more empathy for his critics).  On the other hand, even if we could enter Robin\u2019s mind, it\u2019s not clear to me that we could fully distinguish between the two hypotheses you mentioned. \ud83d\ude42 Rand #200: The fact that there\u2019s a reasonably gender-balanced football fan community, but no reasonably gender-balanced math\/CS fan community, was pretty much exactly my point. Rand #201: I\u2019m sort of curious who else there is in CS theory, male or female, who skipped grades, besides me and Dana and Erik Demaine and maybe a few others I can of (though you probably shouldn\u2019t share names in public). I guess I wouldn\u2019t have \u201ccategorically\u201d ruled out dating anyone merely because she was a categorical semanticist or a type theorist!  On the other hand, that\u2019s also not the \u201ctype\u201d of person I\u2019d meet at any conference I\u2019d normally go to. \ud83d\ude42 josh #203: OK, but here\u2019s a key difference between the cases: neither I, nor as far as I can see anyone else on this thread, has been talking about the type of \u201ccompassion\u201d for shy nerdy males that would say: \u201cit\u2019s fine for you to stay exactly the way you are right now, wallowing in despair.\u201d  Instead we\u2019re talking about the type of compassion that would say: \u201cyou\u2019re fine, you have lots of value as a person, your intellectual abilities are an asset rather than a liability, to the right person they might even be attractive.  You can talk to women, you can ask them on dates, if the dates go well you can even try gently initiating touch.  Contrary to the message you\u2019ve gotten from every SJW forum and book and thinkpiece, doing this will not inherently make you a predator or a creep; it will just make you a normal guy.\u201d Scott #190: .536 for straight single men and .470 for straight single women [\u2026] Of course, one feature of the data that would complicate a \u201credpill\u201d narrative is that the Gini coefficient for men is only modestly higher than the one for women. Usually, when comparing Gini coefficients, you make the implicit assumption that different groups with the same coefficient would experience the same total amount of pleasure (otherwise you would need to argue for e.g. slave mentality being more prevalent in some groups). This assumption is clearly violated in case of the sexes because males have a higher sex drive. An almost equal Gini coefficient likely still implies that there are around 14 times as many suffering men than women, if these numbers are representative: among 25-year-olds, 28% of men but only 2% of women were in this category of \u201creluctant virgins.\u201d (source) Gender equality is thus achieved when the Gini coefficient for men is somewhat lower than that of women. \u201cThey must never under any circumstances be touched without their consent\u2014to be my Zeroth Commandment\u201d. The life is not so simple, and the devil sits in clarification what exactly you mean by \u201cconsent\u201d. Every day we agree to do actions we do not like. For example, a person may not like to cook, but like to eat, and he\/she may agree to an undesirable action (cook) in order to obtain a desirable consequence (eat), or, in other words, to avoid an undesirable consequence (be hungry). When a woman would not like to be \u201ctouched\u201d, but still agree to this in order to obtain some desirable consequence A, or to avoid some undesirable consequence B, would you qualify this as \u201cconsent\u201d? Is this situation consistent with your Zeroth Commandment? scott #208 The kind of compassion you list requires a close relationship to the person in question. Knowing intellectual abilities, the values of the person and the specifics about why the person is in that situation (fear of becoming a creep \u2013 which at least for most people in the same situation that I know is not the reason at all) all demands previous interactions and spending lots of time with the person on a friendship or at least colleague level. So this is certainly not the kind of compassion you can expect from the society. What you can expect from the society at best in my opinion  is not putting extra hurdles for people which are already handicapped  or deprived of certain things in one way or the other. For the record: I think that Robin should never, ever have made this comparison, and I wish he\u2019d apologize for it now. Certainly an inflammatory argument, and while I haven\u2019t read the post yet, whenever these flame wars start I\u2019m always reminded of this apt quote: It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it. \u2013 Aristotle Bogdan #210: Well, I certainly don\u2019t accept the modern SJW definitions of \u201cconsent\u201d\u2014according to which, for example, a person in full control of their faculties who agrees to take a job, but didn\u2019t \u201cgenuinely want\u201d the job and just needed the money, wasn\u2019t \u201creally consenting\u201d to the employment and is therefore enslaved (or, if a prostitute, raped).  In fact, I don\u2019t think the SJWs themselves accept these definitions, were they to be applied consistently or used by others against them: I think they just find it useful to deploy them as weapons against their class enemies. I also think people can have many legitimate reasons to consent to sexual activity besides just being overcome in the moment with lust\u2014e.g., they want to please their partner, they admire the other person\u2019s intellect and want to spend more time with them, etc.  If your partner consents for one of these other reasons, I\u2019m unwilling to say that you\u2019re guilty of sexual coercion. Having said that, I also (as I said in the post) strongly believe in compassion.  I think we often should do more than the bare minimum that\u2019s ethically obligatory, and I\u2019m also often in favor of government helping those in need, even where a libertarian might say that no one did anything to the person without their consent, so whatever they might be suffering is their own damn fault.

Fight! \ud83d\ude42 Scott #200: \nThe fact that there\u2019s a reasonably gender-balanced football fan community, but no reasonably gender-balanced math\/CS fan community, was pretty much exactly my point.\n I didn\u2019t want to engage with your discussion about groupies or people who \u201cserially and preferentially date [scientists]\u201d (who I wouldn\u2019t call groupies) because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something to strive for. I think we want gender parity within these communities, not satellites to them.  (Besides, very few people benefit from increasing numbers of Aaronson or Kripke groupies. [I can name a few of each.] Hmmm, despite teaching graduate logic at MIT at ~19, apparently Kripke only finished Harvard at 21? Weird.) E-sports (where the spectators do form the bulk of the community) is probably a better analogy to football, and having better gender ratios would probably benefit that community greatly. \n\u201cI guess I wouldn\u2019t have \u201ccategorically\u201d ruled out dating anyone merely because she was a categorical semanticist or a type theorist! On the other hand, that\u2019s also not the \u201ctype\u201d of person I\u2019d meet at any conference I\u2019d normally go to.\u201d\n You and your FOCS\/STOC friends better look out. We\u2019ll be back.  (Also, really? Have the ZX people not managed to invade QIP? You\u2019d better look out.) Scott #214: This is perhaps nitpicking, but that sounds more like a radfem notion of consent rather than an SJ notion of consent.  (The two have aren\u2019t unrelated though IMO.) 1.) Kids, prostitution is still supposed to be consensual. With legalized prostitution, where prostitute has ability to defend herself and to choose who she\/he serves, not all men are still going to get sex. That is why prostitutes complain about backpage going down \u2013 because it limit their options to vet and choose customer. It was safer then street, because they could call with dude before meeting him and reject apparently angry ones. You would have to either pay a lot or create horrible conditions for women for them to be willing to go with anyone \u2013 especially with dudes blowing from rage and anger. 2.) As for romance, you cant redistribute that, because there is no romance without free choice. Even if a girl has to pretend she loves you due to some law or social pressure, she likely resents you and there is all there is to it. 3.) Lonely, shy, unattractive, girls exist. Ugly teenage lonely, fat, with acne, unsymmetric features, with social problems, with hard personality girls exist. You all happily ignore them, because they don\u2019t matter. Funny how they dont matter at all.  Lonely old women exist, maybe try to pair with them? A lot of them. They would like someone too. Lonely sick women exist. 4.) Incels are more about social status of possessing hot girl then anything else. I read forums, they don\u2019t care about relationship nor girls personality. They don\u2019t care about anything except how she looks. So, romance is ruled out by that alone. They want trophy girlfriend, so you know, all the debate about loneliness  is mute. tt #219: I don\u2019t know who you mean by \u201cyou all,\u201d but I talked about the need for compassion for lonely women right here in the post that you\u2019re commenting on.  If you won\u2019t take the minimum time to familiarize yourself with the actual views of those you\u2019re responding to\u2014as opposed to, whatever those views get rounded down to in your head\u2014I\u2019ll have to treat you as not participating in good faith, in violation of my comment policy. Enjoyed this post\u2026 Especially where it ended.\n#Compassion #Respect Any thoughts on \u201cego death\u201d for overcoming social tensions? \ud83d\ude42 > I.e.: straight men want sex partly because of the validation of their human worth that they feel will come from knowing that a woman actually likes them enough to want that. And conversely, they want the validation and acceptance partly because that \u2026 It sounds like these men emotional problem that has nothing to do with access to women. And it would be better for both them and their partners if they would disentangle sex from their personal worth. So really, what they need here is counseling. The other person can not give you your worth. It did not worked for middle class housewifes, it does not work for teenage girls who throw themselves at first guy available and it does not work for men. You are asking impossible from the other person and that other person will get tired of trying to give you impossible. And your relationship will break the first moment one of you is too sick to have sex for more then few weeks. Side note: average age of first sex seems to be 18 years old in much of USA and Europe. So, one reason why there is not so much empathy for \u201cnerdy high school and college guys\u201d is that they are virgin at age when it is pretty normal to be virgin in reality \u2013 for both males and females. Just because they party does not mean they have sex. The idea that the other person can change your feelings about yourself so much is a matter of romance literature. You find these kind of scenes there. But again, romance literature seems to help lonely women and is less hateful, so maybe less stigma against it would help guys. Maybe instead if stigmatizing it and knee jerking labeling everyone reading it stupid, we should treat it as a healthy way how to deal with emotions one have or wants to have.  Lastly: I agree with people who pointed out that common sight in CS are guy who do only and exclusively male dominated activities. They plain don\u2019t socialize with women except with close family members and when they hope to date one. Then it is just numbers games. While \u201cswaggering, non-nerdy guys\u201d are not feminine nor picking up knitting, they do go out of their way to gender mixed places and activities where girls are. They have gender mixed friends. Per your own rules somewhere here in comments, girl had to be in CS, which instantly rules out overwhelming majority of women \u2013 whether those women are in fact interested in guys from other majors or not. The girl that spends all free time in knitting club and works in female dominated job wont find partner easily either. Would you be willing to date nurse or biology teacher? Actually, it\u2019s hard to find the exact words of praise when someone is simply telling the truth. Therefore, I wholeheartedly praise you for not being silent. It\u2019s hard to overstate how wrong common understanding of the topic is. Most people know how incorrect and laughable media depiction of their own spheres of interests is (cue the scientist\/journalist comic), but still believe in what they hear about other problems. Telling common folk about \u201cdark corners of Reddit\u201d and 4chan is like telling your grandchildren scary stories about the old barn. Bland lies with which losers reassure themselves are turned into a scary new Nazist ideology. (I\u2019d say there\u2019s a lot of worse falsehoods a lot of people live by that cause large scale tragedies all the time. Also, there\u2019s probably 10\u00d7 stories of man-vs-world showdown like that each day that don\u2019t get media coverage, and 100\u00d7 \u201cusual\u201d man-vs-man accidents like domestic violence, or drunk homicides that are deemed not worthy of attention.) If a female wallows in despair and believes that all those trashy promiscuous men only want cool girls, and she won\u2019t meet any, she is considered a victim of stereotypes who needs a helping hand. If a male wallows in despair and believes that all those trashy promiscuous women only want cool boys, and he won\u2019t meet any, he is a maniac in training. (Don\u2019t forget gay and trans teens and young adults, as that gets complex fast.) Rarely someone tries to understand the ever-present self-humiliation and self-irony of the outbursts (\u2018cos it takes time to accommodate to something you are not used to, and Chads are generally dumb, lol). I wonder whether any outsider can correctly decipher the multifacetedness of the message in this (including the additional meaning from shootings that happened after it was made):  scott #159,\n\u201cAmong the few people I\u2019ve met and had occasion to discuss these matters with, reported number of sexual partners ranges from zero all the way up to hundreds. \u201d the Gini coefficient for men and women is interesting, thank you for the reference. However it\u2019s probably not accurate until corrected for other bias \u2013 has to be interpreted in the light of the knowledge that everyone lies about sex, consistently, constantly, and without exceptions.  Also interesting in that review is the percent of single men and women who had 0 partners in the last year is exactly the same, about 18%.  sex and lies:\nhttp:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/00224499909551999#.U8U3bhCmXGY\n\u201cOn surveys, men report two to four times as many lifetime opposite-sex sexual partners (SPs) as women. However, these estimates should be equivalent because each new sexual partner for a man is also a new sexual partner for a woman.\u201d Another study discussed at http:\/\/mathbabe.org\/2013\/06\/08\/aunt-pythias-advice-19\/\n\u201cwe can\u2019t explain the discrepancy in any way except that women and\/or men are lying about the number of people they\u2019ve slept with.\u201d To be fair it may not be \u2018lies\u2019 as such, more a differing interpretation of what is sex. The GSS has survey data which may or may not be reliable, says,\nhttp:\/\/www.eurekalert.org\/pub_releases\/2015-05\/sdsu-caa050415.php\n\u201cNumber of sexual partners (controlled for age) also shifted substantially, from 2.16 for the Greatest Generation to 11.68 for 1950s-born Boomers and 8.26 for Millennials.\u201d The probably last chance for humanity involves science progressing, can you apply your efforts to quantum computers, which is your expertise, and stop wasting many hours of you time with this shit in related news, I find this account persuasive, how the angry misogynists came to prominence \u2013  http:\/\/crookedtimber.org\/2018\/05\/09\/dark-web-centrism\/\n\u201d I\u2019ve been doing a lot of work on the online origins of the alt-right in PUA and incel culture, Moldbug-cultism and the like. All these people were driven both by a feeling that they were embattled \u2013 that social and cultural structures that had once favored people like them had now shifted. They wanted to be redpilled \u2013 to have the vast invisible structures that imprisoned them revealed, so that they could properly fight back. And when someone handed them an ideology, they took it up eagerly. \u201c tt 222:\n>It sounds like these men emotional problem that has nothing to do with access to women. And it would be better for both them and their partners if they would disentangle sex from their personal worth. So really, what they need here is counseling. Disentangling sex from self-worth for a straight male is impossible for several reasons, unless you brainwash him into denying the obvious reality in front of him:\n1. Sex and courtship is a biological desire. Not being able to accomplish a near universal goal, while others can, means that you are less capable than others. This is not a good thing to know about yourself and no amount of counseling will change that.\n2. Women do not like low-status men. If women do not want to have sex or a relationship with you, this is good evidence that your status is low and that there are probably other things wrong with you as well.\n3. Men and women will judge you on how well you do with the opposite sex, because of reasons 1 and 2.  Now counseling for kids and young adults like this is still plenty worthwhile for other reasons. It could be depression, social anxiety, lack of social skills, or other problems that are causing the lack of love life, and that fixing the underlying issue would help get their lives back on track. The idea that sex is not really important to a healthy life and self-image (or just abhorrent, in the case of abstinence-only sex ed) and that we should just train young people that sex doesn\u2019t matter, is barbaric and I believe history will judge us that way. It used to be a right-wing platform but the left has now become repressive and prudish as well. There is really nothing for Hanson to apologize for in that post, he didn\u2019t argue for redistribution of sex by force or by any other means but instead drew a pretty good parallel between the mindsets of entitlement to material wealth vs. entitlement to sexual fulfillment and the group dynamics they induce all while criticizing the lack of self reflection (or alternatively just hypocrisy) among those claiming to understand the first but not the latter. Outside the Overton galaxy ?  Good, it\u2019s getting really cramped in here. On an Internet that gives a voice to people like Chu and Pao as well as the original incels* this kind of piece needs to be lauded for courage rather than shamed (also some really good insights in the comments towards the end re. sex vs. intimacy like the one by Leandro Montanari Braz). Same goes for you \u2013 I know you believe in the \u201cKolmogorov complicity\u201d but that is both unnecessary and unproductive at this point \u2013 Chu appears to be a miserable Idiot savant** with delusions of adequacy in the field of performance, Pao at this point is basically an untouchable in her industry with a record for both failure and vexatiousness***, these aren\u2019t the inquisitors you\u2019re watching out for but they are base humans who can smell fear, so the more you flounder to explain that you are really really against anyone being raped or otherwise sexually redistributed the more they and their ilk will use this to argue that this is in fact exactly what you support. On the object-level though I can think of one key asymmetry in Hanson\u2019s analogy \u2013 revolutions that spark around wealth distribution happen when a socially cohesive critical mass of people is rallied around them \u2013 such levels of support and cohesion were historically always mediated by sex and lots of it, anyone who spent time in leftist activist circles knows what I\u2019m talking about, the promise of heightened sexual status is all but overt currency \u2013 it was true in Weimar, it was true in Russia, it was true in the 60s and 70s of American counter-culture, and it\u2019s true today \u2013 raise your hand those of you who\u2019ve been actively dating in the coastal US in the last couple of years and didn\u2019t regularly have to go through a political butt-sniffing ritual intended to make sure you\u2019re not a Trump supporter before the end of the first drink. So ironically, one way for the incels to get out of their predicament would be to embrace hard left politics, adopt an ambiguous gender identity, dye their hair blue and start vocally professing their disdain for the white male privilege \u2013 it probably won\u2019t get them a Stacy but Fannys and Gertrudes galore****. And kindly consider rectifying that zeroth commandment to refer to humans instead of women\/females, the parts about chattel and control of their mating choices will still hold remarkably well throughout history for almost the same vast percentage of them. * Assuming that was even an organic thing rather than an act of trollery that went out of control, or even one of the reddit staff-orchestrated puppet shows. (No I\u2019m not saying Pao herself might have had something to do with that, I am however speculatively insinuating it.) ** Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the incel concept in fact just hit too close to home for him. *** That\u2019s like, just my opinion, man. **** Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that, and besides when the revolution comes all the Stacys will be reserved for the nomenclature anyway. \nName (required) \nMail (will not be published) (required) \nWebsite  \n\n   Notify me of follow-up comments by email.

This blog post is the first about the Core Erlang format. In this\nblog post, we introduce the Core Erlang format through examples\nthat compare Erlang code to the corresponding Core Erlang\ncode. I used the following command to translate my example module to\nCore Erlang code: The previous blog post\nexplored the passes from parse_module to expand_records. The\ncore passes translates from the abstract code to Core Erlang. We\nwill talk more about the Core Erlang passes in future blog posts. I have slightly edited the examples to make them somewhat easier to\nread. There will be an unedited example at the very end of this blog post. There\u2019s a lot to cover, so let\u2019s get started! Let start with the simplest possible function, a function with no\narguments returning an atom: In Core Erlang, that will be: From that example, we can work out the following principles: Atoms are always quoted. Naming of the function has been separated from implementation\nof the function. The body of a fun is not followed by an end as in Erlang. Here is as slightly more complicated function: In Core Erlang: Note: All examples were compiled with OTP 20. The name of the\ngenerated variables will be different in the upcoming OTP 21. Essentially, variables are named as in Erlang. In the translation\nto Core Erlang, the compiler generates new variable names for the\narguments in a function head. The following code is also valid\nCore Erlang: Here is a function with more than one clause: In Core Erlang: A fun can only have a single clause. Pattern matching must be done in a case, not in the fun head. Guards are mandatory for each clause in a case. _ is not a valid variable name in Core Erlang. Uninteresting\nvalues must be bound to a new variable. The < and > around the patterns will be explained soon. In Erlang, multiple function clauses can also be written with a\ncase like this: The Core Erlang code will be essentially the same as the Core Erlang\ncode for a\/1: Let\u2019s try multiple arguments: In Core Erlang: < and > denote a value list. The patterns in each clause in\nthe case are always part of a value list. The case expression is\na value list unless there is only one expression. Operators such as + are not part of the Core Erlang language,\nso the compiler has translated the use of + to a call to the\nBIF erlang:'+'\/2. Let\u2019s see how if is implemented: In Core Erlang: In Erlang, a variable can be repeated in a clause or within a\npattern to indicate that the values must be the same: Core Erlang does not allow repeating a variable: This function will fail with a function_clause exception if it is called\nwith any other value than 42: In Core Erlang: A case in Core Erlang must not fall off at the end, that is,\nthere must always be a clause that will match. In this example, the last clause with a variable pattern and\na true guard is guaranteed to match. The body for the last clause calls a primop to generate\na function clause exception. Primops are primitive operations\nprovided by the Erlang implementation, but not specified in the\nCore Erlang language specification. Here is a similar function excepts that is uses case and therefore\nwill generate a case_clause exception if called with any other\nargument than 42: The Core Erlang code is similar to the code for e\/1: Let\u2019s rewrite this function one more time: In Core Erlang: Here is a function that binds the variable I: In Core Erlang: apply calls a fun or local function. The return value of the apply is bound to the variable I. The variable I can only be used in the code that follows the\nin keyword. The variable name is in a value list. That is because let\ncan bind several variables at once. Erlang has essentially no scoping. When a variable has been bound,\nit remains bound to the end of the function. For example, variables bound\nin a case can be used after the case: In Core Erlang: A case in Core Erlang does not export any variables. All variables\nthat are to be used after the case must be explicitly returned. In this example, the first two clauses of the case return a\nvalue list with three values. The first value is the return value\nof the case, which in this case is ignored. The other two values are\nthe values assigned to the X and Y variables, respectively. The values returned from the case is bound in the let. The ignored\nreturn value is bound to a new variable (_@c7), which is never used.\nThe exported values are bound to the X and Y variables. So far all Core Erlang examples have been edited to make the points\nI am trying to make stand out clearer. Let\u2019s have a look at the unedited\nversion of a previous example: The -| associates an annotation with a Core Erlang construct.\nThe meaning of an annotation is not specified in the Core Erlang\nlanguage specification. The compiler_generated annotation associated with the last clause\nis a hint added by the compiler that subsequent optimization passes should\nnot generate a warning if the clause was found to never match and dropped. The comment \u201cLine 33\u201d at the beginning is actually an annotation that\nthe pretty printer has turned into a comment to avoid rendering the\npretty-printed code unreadable. Core Erlang is less complicated than Erlang, and is therefore more\nsuited than the abstract format for code analyzing tools (such as\nDialyzer) and optimizers. All details can be found in Core Erlang 1.0.3 language specification.","time":1525693234,"title":"Core Erlang by Example","type":"story","url":"http:\/\/blog.erlang.org\/core-erlang-by-example\/","label":7,"label_name":"random"},{"by":"denzil_correa","descendants":136,"id":17011938,"kids":"[17013534, 17013770, 17014064, 17013095, 17013295, 17013813, 17013195, 17014052, 17013218, 17014116, 17013231, 17013845, 17013464, 17014193, 17015722, 17014817, 17014275, 17014332, 17013694, 17015106, 17013164, 17013049, 17013649]","score":224,"text":"\n\n\n\nSEARCH MIT MANAGEMENT\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBy Rebecca Linke \u00a0|\u00a0\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tJanuary 30, 2018\n\t\t \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGiveDirectly will be transferring money to 21,000 Kenyans.\n\t\t\t\t\n \n          The idea of a universal basic income is not new, but the theory has never been thoroughly tested. A massive new study is about to change that.\n         For the next 12 years, MIT Sloan associate professor Tavneet Suri will be part of a team collaborating with the nonprofit     GiveDirectly to study the effects of implementing a universal basic income in Kenya. Suri is conducting the research along with MIT professor Abhijit Banerjee, Princeton professor Alan Krueger, University of California San Diego professor Paul Niehaus, and GiveDirectly president Michael Faye. Overall, GiveDirectly expects to transfer $25 million to more than 21,000 people (not including the control group), 5,000 of whom will receive cash transfers for 12 years. The money comes with no strings attached. The study will be divided into four groups: one will receive the equivalent of 75 cents a day per person for 12 years; one will receive the 75 cents a day per person for two years; one will receive the same amount of money (in net present value) as the two-year group in an up-front lump sum; and a fourth group will act as a control group, receiving nothing. People who advocate for a universal basic income say it will be a way to pull people out of poverty. Skeptics think a universal basic income will act as a disincentive for people to work. \u201cIt is easy to have opinions without evidence,\u201d Suri said. \u201cIt is time we tried to gather some evidence and started thinking about what the impacts truly are and how it changes people\u2019s lives.\u201d The researchers hope the study answers several questions. How will having a guaranteed income affect wealth, security, how people use their time, employment levels, efforts to find work, childcare health outcomes, and women\u2019s empowerment? Will more people pursue educational opportunities? Will there be any mental health benefits? Another main goal of the study, aside from helping alleviate poverty, is to have solid information to provide to policymakers. \u201cIf we want policymakers to do this, we can point to the benefits of the different arms of the study and say, \u2018Here is the menu. You choose,\u2019\u201d Suri said. Enrollment for the study started in November 2017 and will likely be completed by the end of April. About 10 percent of recipients have begun receiving cash transfers already. GiveDirectly expects all participants will be receiving money by May. Several other basic income experiments, including one     giving money to 2,000 people in Finland, are ongoing, but the GiveDirectly study is by far the largest and longest, which Suri says will allow her team to gather more data, discerning more overall effects and potentially smaller effects than is possible with smaller studies. The researchers will continue to produce results while the study is ongoing, with the first follow-up scheduled for next year. \u201cI expect we will have a stream of results,\u201d Suri said. \u201cIf it is really going to change the villages in the long-term like we expect, you want to watch that as it happens. Are there any big changes?

It explains why the so-called zeta values \u2014 numbers that have preoccupied mathematicians since the mid-18th century \u2014 are implicated in the numerical mystery at the heart of one of the most active fields in contemporary mathematics. \u201cOur work gives some kind of geometric explanation for the origin of these strange numbers,\u201d said Nick Sheridan, a research fellow at the University of Cambridge and co-author of the work. The zeta values are numbers generated by taking an infinite sum. For example, zeta of 2 is equal to 1 + 1\/22 + 1\/32 + 1\/42 + \u2026 , while zeta of 3 is equal to 1 + 1\/23 + 1\/33 + 1\/43 + \u2026. The zeta values appear in many areas of mathematics, including, most famously, the Riemann hypothesis, which relates to the distribution of prime numbers. As I explained in my recent feature story on the state of mirror symmetry, \u201cMathematicians Explore Mirror Link Between Two Geometric Worlds,\u201d the field was discovered by accident. In the early 1990s, physicists were trying to figure out the details of string theory. They wanted to explain the physical world as a product of tiny, vibrating strings woven through an additional six dimensions of space. They tried to understand what the geometry of those six dimensions might be. The first option came from the mathematical field of algebraic geometry; a second one came from the mathematical field of symplectic geometry. To the trained mathematical eye, the two could hardly have seemed more different. And yet, the physicists noticed some strange similarities between them. In particular, when they performed a calculation on one space, they generated numbers that matched the numbers they generated when they performed a very different type of calculation on the other side. \u201cTwo things that looked, in principle, unrelated, magically were equal,\u201d said Denis Auroux, a mathematician at the University of California, Berkeley. Mathematicians and physicists began excavating the mirror relationship. They soon built increasingly abstracted mathematical entities atop the foundations of the underlying symplectic and complex geometric spaces. You can think of these more abstract mathematical entities as houses whose architecture reflects the foundations they\u2019ve been built on. In the setting of mirror symmetry, points on the house whose coordinate values previously were integers become points whose coordinate values are now multiples of different zeta values. The process effectively rotates the space. \u201cIt\u2019s been rotated, and the amount it\u2019s been rotated by maybe will involve some of these zeta values,\u201d said Sheridan. Mathematicians have noticed the presence of zeta values almost since the beginning of the study of mirror symmetry. \u201cThe arithmetic is fascinating and has been explored in a lot of examples, but it\u2019s missing a conceptual explanation. We\u2019ve been trying to get more of a conceptual explanation,\u201d said Sheel Ganatra, a mathematician at the University of Southern California and co-author of the new work along with Sheridan, Mohammed Abouzaid of Columbia University and Hiroshi Iritani of Kyoto University. This new work explains why the zeta values are there. The explanation has to do with intrinsic geometric features of the two sides of mirror symmetry. A foundational question in mirror symmetry, called the SYZ conjecture, says it should be possible to take one mirror space, break it down into pieces, manipulate those pieces, and then use them to construct the second mirror space. It\u2019s as though you had a big shape made of Legos, took it apart, and used the pieces to build something new. When you break down the first space into Lego-like pieces, most of the pieces will be the same, but there will also be some special blocks \u2014 the odd green or yellow piece in a sea of reds and blues. In their new work, the mathematicians prove that each kind of special piece is associated to a zeta value. Maybe the green blocks are associated to zeta of 2, and therefore if you have five greens when you take apart your first mirror space, the structure atop your rebuilt mirror space will have its coordinates offset by a factor of five times zeta of 2. In this new work, the four mathematicians use techniques from a field called tropical geometry. Using those techniques, they prove that these \u201cspecial pieces\u201d explain why numbers on opposite sides of the mirror differ by exactly a factor of zeta values. So far, their proof holds for many cases of mirror symmetry. The authors are waiting until they\u2019ve been able to prove even more cases before they make the proof public. The work is also emblematic of an overall trend in mirror symmetry. The field began in revelation and is advancing rapidly toward understanding. Instead of simply cataloging mysterious phenomena \u2014 these sets of numbers match! \u2014 mathematicians are beginning to really explain why mirror phenomena occur at all.

What\u2019s fun about neural networks is they learn by example - give them a bunch of some sort of data, and they\u2019ll try to figure out rules that let them imitate it. They power corporate finances, recognize faces, translate text, and more. I, however, like to give them silly datasets. I\u2019ve trained neural networks to generate new\u00a0paint\u00a0colors, new\u00a0Halloween costumes, and new\u00a0candy heart messages. When the problem is tough, the results are mixed (there was that one candy heart that just said HOLE). One of the toughest problems I\u2019ve ever tried? Knitting patterns. I knew almost nothing about knitting when\u00a0@JohannaB@wandering.shop\u00a0sent me the suggestion one day. She sent me to the\u00a0Ravelry knitting site, and to its adults-only, often-indecorous\u00a0LSG forum, who as you will see are amazing people. (When asked how I should describe them, one wrote \u201cdon\u2019t forget the glitter and swearing!\u201d) And so, we embarked upon\u00a0Operation Hilarious Knitting Disaster. The knitters helped me crowdsource a dataset of 500 knitting patterns, ranging from hats to squids to unmentionables. JC Briar exported another 4728 patterns from\u00a0the site\u00a0stitch-maps.com.\u00a0 I gave the knitting patterns to a couple of neural networks that I collectively named \u201cSkyKnit\u201d. Then, not knowing if they had produced anything remotely knittable, I started posting the patterns. Here\u2019s an early example. MrsNoddyNoddy wrote, \u201cit\u2019s difficult to explain why 6395, 71, 70, 77 is so asthma-inducingly funny.\u201d (It seems that a 6000-plus stitch count is, as GloriaHanlon put it,\u00a0\u201coptimism\u201d).\u00a0 As training progressed, and as I tried some higher-performance models, SkyKnit improved. Here\u2019s a later example. Even at its best, SkyKnit had problems. It would sometimes repeat rows, or leave them out entirely. It could count rows fairly reliably up to about 22, but after that would start haphazardly guessing random largish numbers. SkyKnit also had trouble counting stitches, and would confidently declare at the end of certain lines that it contained 12 stitches when it was nothing of the sort. But the knitters began knitting them. This possibly marks one of the few times in history when a computer generated code to be executed by humans. [Mystery lace\u00a0- datasock] [Reverss Shawl\u00a0- citikas] [Frost - Odonata] The knitters didn\u2019t follow SkyKnit\u2019s directions exactly, as it turns out. For most of its patterns, doing them exactly as written would result in the pattern immediately unraveling (due to many dropped stitches), or turning into long whiplike tentacles (due to lots of leftover stitches). Or, to make the row counts match up with one another, they would have had to keep repeating the pattern until they\u2019d reached a multiple of each row count - sometimes this was possible after a few repeats, while other times they would have had to make the pattern tens of thousands of stitches long. And other times, missing rows made the directions just plain impossible.\u00a0 So, the knitters just started fixing SkyKnit\u2019s patterns. Knitters are very good at debugging patterns, as it turns out. Not only are there a lot of knitters who are coders, but debugging is such a regular part of knitting that the complicated math becomes second nature. Notation is not always consistent, some patterns need to be adjusted for size, and some simply have mistakes. The knitters were used to taking these problems in stride. When working with one of SkyKnit\u2019s patterns, GloriaHanlon wrote, \u201cI\u2019m trying not to fudge too much, basically working on the principle that the\u00a0pattern was written by an elderly relative who doesn\u2019t speak much English.\u201d Each pattern required a different debugging approach, and sometimes knitters would each produce their own very different-looking versions. Here are three versions of\u00a0\u201cPaw Not Pointed 2 Stitch 2\u2033. [Top - ActualJellyfish;\u00a0Middle - LadyAurian;\u00a0Bottom (sock version) - ShoelessJane] Once, knitter MeganAnn came across a stitch that didn\u2019t even exist (something SkyKnit called \u2019pbk\u2019). So she had to improvise. \u201cI googled it and went with the first definition I got, which was \u2018place bead and knit\u2019.\u201d The resulting pattern is \u201cRibbed Rib Rib\u201d below (note bead). [Ribbed Rib Rib - MeganAnn] Even debugged, the patterns were weird. Like, really, really nonhumanly weird. \u201cI love how organic it comes out,\u201c wrote Vastra. SylviaTX agreed, loving \u201cthe organic seeming randomness. Like bubbles on water or something,\u201d\u00a0 SkyKnit\u2019s patterns were also a pain.\u00a0Michaela112358 called Row 15 of Mystery Lace (above) \u201ca bit of a head melter\u201d, commenting that it \u201clacked the rhythm that you tend to get with a normal pattern\u201d. Maeve_ish wrote that Shetland Bird Pat \u201cmade my brain hurt so I went to bed.\u201d ShoelessJane asked, \u201cOkay, now who here has read Snow Crash?\u201d [Winder Socks (2 versions) - TotesMyName] \u201cI was laughing a few days ago because I was trying to math a Skyknit pattern and my brain\u2026froze. Like, no longer could number at all. I stared blankly at my scribbles and at the screen wondering what had happened til somehow I rebooted. Yup, Skyknit crashed my brain.\u201d - Rayn63 [Paw chain 2\u00a0-\u00a0HMSChicago] On the pattern SkyKnit called \u201cCherry and Acorns Twisted To\u201d: \u201cCouple notes on the knitting experience, which while funny wasn\u2019t terribly pleasurable: Because there\u2019s no rhythm or symmetry to the pattern, I felt I was white-knuckling it through each line, really having to concentrate. There are also some stitch combinations that aren\u2019t very comfortable to execute physically, YO, SSK in particular. That said, I\u2019m nearly tempted to add a bit of random AI lace to a project, perhaps as cuffs on a sweater or a short-row lace panel in part of a scarf, like\u00a0Sylvia McFadden\u00a0does in many of her shawl designs.

I still have a lingering suspicion that I\u2019m knitting a pattern that could someday communicate to an AI that I want to play a game of Global Thermonuclear War, but I suppose at least I\u2019ll have a scarf at the end of it?\u201d -BridgetJ [butnet scarf\u00a0- BridgetJ] There was also this beauty of a pattern, that SkyKnit called \u201cTiny Baby Whale Soto\u201d. GloriaHanlon managed somehow to knit it and described it as\u00a0\u201ca bona fide eldritch horror. Think Slenderman meets Cthulu and you wouldn\u2019t be far wrong.\u201d [Tiny Baby Whale Soto - GloriaHanlon] Other than being a bit afraid of Tiny Baby Whale Soto, the knitters seem happy to do the bidding of SkyKnit, brain melts and all. \u201cI cast on for a lovely MKAL with a designer I totally trust and became immediately suspicious because the pattern made sense. All rows increase in an orderly manner. There are no \u201chuh?\u201d moments. There are no maths at all\u2026it has all been done for me. I thought I would be happy, yo. Instead, I am kind of missing the brain scrambling and I keep looking for pigs and tentacles.

To train the fastest algorithms, they say, you need the most expansive datasets and the beefiest processors. Just look at Facebook\u2019s announcement last week that it created one of the most accurate object recognition systems in the world using a dataset of 3.5 billion images. (All taken from Instagram, naturally.) This narrative benefits tech giants, helping them attract talent and investment, but a recent AI competition organized by Stanford University shows the conventional wisdom isn\u2019t always true. Fittingly enough for the field of artificial intelligence, it turns out brains can still beat brawn.  The proof comes from the DAWNBench challenge, which was announced by Stanford researchers last November and the winners declared last week. Think of DAWNBench as an athletics meet for AI engineers, with hurdles and long jump replaced by tasks like object recognition and reading comprehension. Teams and individuals from universities, government departments, and industry competed to design the best algorithms, with Stanford\u2019s researchers acting as adjudicators. Each entry had to meet basic accuracy standards (for example, recognizing 93 percent of dogs in a given dataset) and was judged on metrics like how long it took to train an algorithm and how much it cost. These metrics were chosen to reflect the real-world demands of AI, explain Stanford\u2019s Matei Zaharia and Cody Coleman. \u201cBy measuring the cost [...] you can find out if you\u2019re a smaller group if you need Google-level infrastructure to compete,\u201d Zaharia tells The Verge. And by measuring training speed, you know how long it takes to implement an AI solution. In other words, these metrics help us judge whether small teams can take on the tech giants.  The results don\u2019t give a straightforward answer, but they suggest that raw computing power isn\u2019t the be-all and end-all for AI success. Ingenuity in how you design your algorithms counts for at least as much. While big tech companies like Google and Intel had predictably strong showings in a number of tasks, smaller teams (and even individuals) ranked highly by using unusual and little-known techniques.  Take, for example, one of DAWNBench\u2019s object recognition challenges, which required teams to train an algorithm that could identify items in a picture database called CIFAR-10. Databases like this are common in AI, and are used for research and experimentation. CIFAR-10 is a relatively old example, but mirrors the sort of data a real company might expect to deal with. It contains 60,000 small images, just 32 pixels by 32 pixels in size, with each picture falling into one of ten categories such as \u201cdog,\u201d \u201cfrog,\u201d \u201cship,\u201d or \u201ctruck.\u201d  In DAWNBench\u2019s league tables, the top three spots for fastest and cheapest algorithms to train were all taken by researchers affiliated with one group: Fast.AI. Fast.AI isn\u2019t a big research lab, but a non-profit group that creates learning resources and is dedicated to making deep learning \u201caccessible to all.\u201d The institute\u2019s co-founder, entrepreneur and data scientist Jeremy Howard, tells The Verge that his students\u2019 victory was down to thinking creatively, and that this shows that anyone can \u201cget world class results using basic resources.\u201d Howard explains that in order to create an algorithm for solving CIFAR, Fast.AI\u2019s group turned to a relatively unknown technique known as \u201csuper convergence.\u201d This wasn\u2019t developed by a well-funded tech company or published in a big journal, but was created and self-published by a single engineer named Leslie Smith working at the Naval Research Laboratory. Essentially, super convergence works by slowly increasing the flow of data used to train an algorithm. Think of it like this, if you were teaching someone to identify trees, you wouldn\u2019t start by showing them a forest. Instead, you\u2019d introduce information to them slowly, starting by teaching them what individual species and leaves look like. This is a bit of a simplification, but the upshot is that by using super convergence, Fast.ai\u2019s algorithms were considerably speedier than the competition\u2019s. They were able to train an algorithm that could sort CIFAR with the required accuracy in just under three minutes. The next fastest team that didn\u2019t use super convergence took more than half an hour.  It didn\u2019t all go Fast.AI\u2019s way though. In another challenge using object recognition to sort through a database called ImageNet, Google romped home, taking the top three positions in training time, and the first and second in training cost. (Fast.AI took third place in cost and fourth place in time.) However, Google\u2019s algorithms for were all running on the company\u2019s custom AI hardware; chips designed specially for the task known as Tensor Processing Units or TPUs. In fact, for some of the tasks Google used what it calls a TPU \u201cpod,\u201d which is 64 TPU chips running in tandem. . By comparison, Fast.AI\u2019s entries used regular Nvidia GPUs running off a single bog-standard PC; hardware that\u2019s more readily available to all.  \u201cThe fact that Google has a private infrastructure that can train things easily is interesting but perhaps not completely relevant,\u201d says Howard. \u201cWhereas, finding out you can do much the same thing with a single machine in three hours for $25 is extremely relevant.\u201d These ImageNet results are revealing precisely because they\u2019re ambiguous. Yes, Google\u2019s hardware reigned supreme, but is that a surprise when we\u2019re talking about one of the richest tech companies in the world? And yes, while Fast.AI\u2019s students did come up with a creative solution, it\u2019s not that Google\u2019s wasn\u2019t also ingenious. One of the company\u2019s entries made use of what it calls \u201cAutoML\u201d \u2014 a set of algorithms that search for the best algorithm for a given task without human direction. In other words, AI that designs AI.  The challenge of understanding these results is just not a matter of finding out who\u2019s best \u2014 they have clear social and political implications. For example, consider the question of who controls the future of artificial intelligence. Will it be big tech companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google, who will use AI to increase their power and wealth; or will the benefits be more evenly and democratically available?  For Howard, these are crucial questions. \u201cI don\u2019t want deep learning to remain the exclusive venue of a small number of privileged people,\u201d he says. \u201cIt really bothers me, talking to young practitioners and students, this message that being big is everything. It\u2019s a great message for companies like Google because they get to recruit folks because they believe that unless you go to Google you can\u2019t do good work. But it\u2019s not true.\u201d Sadly, we can\u2019t be AI soothsayers. No one can predict the future of the industry by examining the bones of the DAWNBench challenge. And indeed, if the results of this competition show anything, it\u2019s that this is a field still very much in flux. Will small and nimble algorithms decide the future of AI or will it be raw computing power? Nobody can say, and expecting a simple answer would be unreasonable anyway.  Zaharia and Coleman, two of the DAWNBench organizers, say they\u2019re just happy to see the competition provoke such a range of responses. \u201cThere was a tremendous amount of diversity,\u201d says Coleman. \u201cI\u2019m not too worried about [one company] taking over the industry just based on what\u2019s happened with deep learning. We\u2019re still at a time where there\u2019s an explosion of frameworks going on [and] a lot of sharing of ideas.\u201d The pair point out that although it was not a criteria for the competition, the vast majority of   entries to DAWNBench were open-sourced. That means their underlying code was posted online, and that anyone can examine it, implement it, and learn from it. That way, they say, whoever wins in DAWNBench\u2019s challenges, everybody benefits.

This is a country that gave the world song. In Syria, music runs deeper into the fabric of the place than anywhere else in the world. Long before the modern state was formed in 1946, Syria had developed rich musical traditions over thousands of years. The diverse religions, sects and ethnicities that inhabited and travelled across the country over the millennia \u2013 Muslims, Christians, Jews, Arabs, Assyrians, Armenians and Kurds, to name but a few \u2013 all contributed to this eclectic musical heritage.  This media cannot be played on your device. Songs of ancient Syria In the 1950s, archaeologists found 29 3,400-year-old clay tablets in a small cubicle \u2013 likely a library \u2013 in the ancient port city of Ugarit on Syria\u2019s Mediterranean coast. They were mostly broken into tiny fragments, but one, which came to be known as H6, remained in larger pieces. Inscribed on it were lyrics, and underneath them is what researchers believe is the earliest example of musical notation anywhere in the world. You may also be interested in: \u2022\u00a0The world\u2019s oldest centre of learning  \u2022\u00a0Where algebra was invented\u2022\u00a0The dessert that\u2019s blocked at borders These shards of clay are the beginnings of an incomparable musical heritage. Academics have spent years literally piecing together the tablets, trying to work out what was written on them, what it meant and how the musical notation might sound were it to be played again. The text is in Babylonian cuneiform script, a system of writing that spread throughout the region several millennia ago.  We could read the script... but we didn\u2019t have any idea what it meant  \u201cThe problem with this tablet is that \u2013 we could read the script because it was written in Babylonian cuneiform, and we know the value of the signs \u2013 but we didn\u2019t have any idea what it meant,\u201d said Richard Dumbrill,\u00a0professor of archaeomusicology at Babylon University in Iraq, who has worked on the Ugarit tablets for more than two decades. Dumbrill described how he attempted on many occasions to reconstruct the Ugarit tablets in order to translate the text and music inscribed on them: \u201cI took photographs and I tried to build them as a puzzle, but some had been damaged beyond reconstruction.\u201d  The translation difficulties were a product of the text being written in a language known as Hurrian from the north-east Caucasus, probably in modern-day Armenia, but which ended up in Syria\u2019s fertile lands. \u201cThese people migrated towards north-west Syria \u2013 it took them a good couple of thousand years \u2013 and decided to use the Babylonian signs to write their text and their music,\u201d Dumbrill said. \u201cSo it was extremely difficult to translate. However, I managed to find out that the text below the two lines were musical names that were Hurrianised \u2013 that is, they were Babylonian but had been transformed on contact with the Hurrian people. And I could find out that it was a melody. It took me about 20 years to translate.\u201d So what does the earliest musical composition tell us about the people who lived at that time? From Dumbrill\u2019s translations, he believes they had catalogues of songs for occasions of all sorts and moods, not just hymns for religious events. One song details a bar girl selling beer to her clients, but the tablet known as H6 details a more sober story. \u201cIt\u2019s about a young girl who cannot have any children; she thinks that the reason is because she misbehaved in some way, which is not mentioned,\u201d Dumbrill said. \u201cAnd from what we can understand of the text, which is quite limited, she goes at night to pray to the goddess Nigal, who was the goddess of the moon. She brings a little pot of tin with sesame seeds or sesame oil in it, which she offers to the goddess, and that\u2019s all we know about the text.\u201d  An ancient musical workshop But Syria did not produce only the earliest melody. Over time, a rich array of musical instruments on which to play them also formed across the region, such as the lyre, a stringed musical instrument with a yoke and a crossbar, and lutes, which evolved into the modern Arabian oud, a teardrop-shaped plucked string instrument that produces one of the most evocative sounds in the region. At Mari, an Early Bronze Age city-state on the banks of the Euphrates river in eastern modern-day Syria, researchers in the 20th Century uncovered a number of records detailing the musical instrument-making business of the time. \u201cThere in the palace [at Mari] we discovered a huge number of tablets which were mainly letters and receipts of material from artisans who were requesting leather, raw hide, wood, gold and silver for making instruments,\u201d Dumbrill said. \u201cTherefore we have a very good idea about the instruments that were made about 4,000 years ago. We knew the names of the artisans, we knew the type of instruments they made. They were already influenced by instruments which were not Syrian,\u201d he added, citing the Iranian parahshitum as an example, a type of lyre that became very popular among the girls of the harem at Mari. Production of musical instruments continued to flourish in Syria over the centuries, and many are preserved in collections open to visitors today.  At the Debban\u00e9 Palace in the Lebanese coastal city of Saida, for example, a collection of Ottoman-era musical instruments, dating from around the 19th Century, gives visitors an insight into the traditions present across both Lebanon and Syria before the formation of the modern states. Pieces from Syria include ouds and bouzouks (a small lute with a long, slim arm) inlaid with wood and ivory. \u201cPeople [visiting] ask, why are there so many musical instruments?\u201d said Ghassan Dimassy, a guide at the Debban\u00e9 Palace. \u201cWe tell them that this is an Ottoman house and the women used to sit and sing.\u201d He mimicked the women playing a musical instrument and the men lying back and relaxing; here, music was the essential backdrop to any leisure occasion. A music in exile Last year, Syrian authorities launched a bid to have Aleppo, Syria\u2019s second city, added\u00a0to Unesco's Creative Cities Network as a \u2018City of Music\u2019 to commemorate its heritage. During the 17th Century, Aleppo was renowned for its muwashshah, a form of music combined with lyrics from Andalusian poetry, classical Arabic poetry, or, later on, Syrian or Egyptian conversational Arabic. Muwashshah are performed by a band playing the oud and qanun (a horizontal board with strings plucked to produce a haunting sound like trickling water), as well as the kamanja (a violin-like instrument), a darabukkah (drum), and a daf (tambourine). The form thrived in the city, where it was embraced by both Muslim and Christian populations. However, significant efforts to preserve Syria\u2019s musical traditions are now also found outside this country, which has entered its eighth year of conflict and where civilians have in large part been forced to focus attention on survival rather than exploring their cultural heritage. Some Syrian youth are making the best of a difficult situation and are bringing Syria's rich musical history into the limelight.  Long an incubator of creative talent, Beirut has become a crucible for preserving Syrian musical heritage. Me'zaf, an organisation founded in the Lebanese capital in 2015, aims to innovate, promote and preserve authentic music from not just Syria, but the Levantine region as a whole, showing how the Middle East\u2019s rich musical traditions precede the modern nation-state borders introduced in the 20th Century. \u201cA lot of forms were created in Damascus or Aleppo and were taken to Cairo, then forms were created in Cairo and performed in the Levant,\u201d explained Ghassan Sahhab, a Me'zaf leader and Lebanese musicology teacher, composer and qanun player. \u201cWe have a rich culture and we have to appreciate it and know our history in order to continue. At the moment, it\u2019s a case of preserving heritage and culture.\u201d Another musical troupe that formed in Beirut is Assa'aleek, which consists of five Syrians and a Norwegian. The band\u2019s name means \u2018the ragamuffins\u2019 or \u2018the vagabonds\u2019 in Arabic, and refers to a group of self-proclaimed Robin Hood-type characters who lived during the pre-Islamic era in the Arabian Gulf and tried to change the ways of the ruling class.  This media cannot be played on your device. \u201cWe are similar to the Assa'aleek: we were forced out of our communities and homeland for many reasons,\u201d said Abodi Jatal, percussion player in Assa'aleek. \u201cIt is important to preserve ancient Syrian music because this is our identity, it is history and it is civilisation, after all. This is what we have. This is what we are,\u201d said Assa'aleek vocalist Mona Al Merstany. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about a normal country \u2013 it\u2019s one of the most ancient countries. It is important to show such things because all people have the right to see beauty.\u201d  It is important to preserve ancient Syrian music because this is our identity  They see music as a way of fighting the injustices faced on a daily basis by people in the region. \u201cOur lyrics and songs, this is what they are built on,\u201d Jatal said. \u201cWe wanted to fight against bad habits, such as harassment against women, and we saw that this is really similar to what the Assa'aleek did, so that\u2019s why we used the name.\u201d As well as new songs, the band has been performing Syrian folk music since 2013, bringing music from across Syria\u2019s diverse landscapes and communities to audiences in Lebanon. Syrian music heritage has come a long way since the melody found on the clay tablets at Ugarit. Today, bands such as Assa'aleek are reinventing the definition of Syrian music, bringing it to new audiences.  Meanwhile, they are developing the sounds that museoarchaeologists of the future might one day find, stored on computers, in files or drawers, in Aleppo, Damascus or Beirut, or even Paris, London or Berlin. Al Merstany sums it up well: \u201cWhen someone asks me what is Syria, this is what I have to say: the music, the art.\u201d Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on\u00a0Facebook, or follow us on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.

I\u2019m going to explain what I did and why it involved more work than I first thought, this isn\u2019t a tutorial but the code is on GitHub if you want to have a look. I chose a stack that would challenge me to develop new and existing skills. It had been a while since I had written any Go, and it was a good opportunity to try out AWS Fargate. I started off with a simple web server to act as an endpoint to be called by the build system which would accept a POST request and print it to stdout. I bundled the app within a Docker container, opened up the AWS console and within 10 minutes it was deployed. I could now add the callback to my build config so it would be called after every build, however I quickly ran into my first issue; CircleCI doesn\u2019t allow environment variables to be used when defining a callback URL. This was a problem because I have no way of verifying the payload actually came from CircleCI. I devised a solution which involved using the data in the payload to query the CircleCI API. It took some time trying to work out why my request to the API was failing, I now know that the Accept application\/json header is required for their API to function. With the endpoint operating and able to check whether a build has passed or failed, it was time to get to work on the fail jar. Having looked at the Monzo API a few days before, it seemed like it would be nice and simple to transfer money into a pot (money you can\u2019t spend until you transfer it back to your current account). However I\u2019d assumed I could authenticate myself with a long-life API key. Instead I needed to setup an oAuth flow and then refresh the token regularly thereafter. I setup a DynamoDB table to store my users\u2019 access token and expiration, refreshing the token when it had expired. None of this was too difficult, but I certainly hadn\u2019t expected to have to do this when I started. Success! I have money going into a pot every time a build fails. I hear you ask why this is actually costing me money since at the moment the money is mine, but in a separate part of my bank account. Well yeah you\u2019re right. I\u2019m going to run this for a few weeks \/ months and donate the money in the pot to charity. This is not the most economical way of running an API like this. The smallest Fargate instance (0.25vCPU and 0.5gb memory) and provisioned DynamoDB table costs ~$13.43\/month, and that\u2019s before some additional costs such as the load balancer, ECR, and data transfer. This would be much cheaper running as a Lambda. But that\u2019s not the point, this was just for fun. I wanted to work on something interesting, but which I could complete in a day despite not realising I would need to call the CircleCI API or setup an authentication flow with Monzo, this was comfortably a day\u2019s work.

Religions have long been the dominant suppliers of rituals, gamely stepping in with an answer to every question from How do I celebrate the birth of my baby boy? to How can I transfer my own sins onto a live chicken? But in an age of increasing religious disaffiliation, these rituals now feel hollow to millions of people. And even when they don\u2019t, there\u2019s a wide range of new experiences for which the traditional rituals offer no script: How do I cope with my rage after receiving a parking ticket? How can I keep a smart car from exacerbating my loneliness and narcissism? What can I do to mourn the death of my laptop? Although there is no single agreed-upon definition, a ritual is typically a deliberate action performed in a set sequence that improves our emotional state, by reframing an experience in a way that feels meaningful. At the Ritual Design Lab in Silicon Valley, a small team of \u201cinteraction designers\u201d is working to generate new rituals for modern life, with an eye to user experience. Created by Kursat Ozenc and Margaret Hagan, the lab crafts rituals for both individuals and organizations, including big hitters like Microsoft. The team\u2019s website offers a Ritual Design Hotline with a tantalizing promise: \u201cYou tell us your problem. We will make you a ritual.\u201d Meanwhile, its Ritual Inventory invites you to add any interesting ritual you\u2019ve made or seen to its growing database. And its app, IdeaPop, helps you brainstorm and create your own rituals. Ritual Design Lab has its roots in Stanford\u2019s Institute of Design, where Ozenc and Hagan both teach. In 2015, they proposed a new course on ritual design. To their surprise, more than 100 students signed up. Most were secular. \u201cThe interest was huge\u2014so we thought, we should harness this interest,\u201d Ozenc told me. \u201cThe new generation, they want bite-size spirituality instead of a whole menu of courses. Design thinking can offer this, because the whole premise of design is human-centeredness. It can help people shape their spirituality based on their needs. Institutionalized religions somehow forget this\u2014that at the center of any religion should be the person.\u201d Ozenc, 38, is no stranger to institutionalized religion. Growing up in Turkey, he practiced Sufi Islam\u2014and he still does. \u201cI know the value of spirituality,\u201d he said. To help others access that value, he homes in on what he considers ingredients for a good ritual. One is the bite-sized portion size; whenever possible, a ritual should be quick. Another key ingredient is playfulness. In fact, some of the rituals listed on the website border on silly. The ritual for coping with parking-ticket rage involves saut\u00e9ing and then eating the ticket. \u201cWe intentionally take the stance that we believe in rituals that are lightweight and a bit humorous,\u201d Ozenc told me. \u201cWe\u2019re not interested in heavy, top-bottom, religious, or government rituals.\u201d The importance of play in ritual is backed up by evolutionary biology: It facilitates problem-solving and social bonding among bonobos, as primatologist Isabel Behncke has shown. Ozenc and Hagan take play so seriously that they\u2019ve actually had Behncke co-teach alongside them in Stanford\u2019s ritual-design classes. They\u2019ve also collaborated with neuropsychologist Nick Hobson, who studies ritual\u2019s impact on neural processes and writes about the power of playful rituals\u2014even ones as simple as playing ping-pong during your lunch break at work. Some of Ritual Design Lab\u2019s work has more heft. Ozenc is preparing to roll out a project called Pop-Up Prayer, which aims to give urban young professionals a way to pray when they\u2019re on the go. Here\u2019s how it works: An organization buys a prayer kit, puts it in a room where it\u2019s okay for a visitor to pray, and posts an online listing. You find the building using your smartphone (as with other location-based services), go to the room, take what you need from the kit, and use it to pray. Then you put everything back where you found it. The first kit to be debuted will be geared toward young Muslims\u2014or \u201cMipsters,\u201d as Ozenc calls them\u2014and will contain a prayer rug, a compass, water, and a prayer book. Subsequent models will be geared toward Jews and Christians. The multi-faith aspect of the project makes perfect sense, given that Ozenc didn\u2019t create it by himself: He came up with the idea in collaboration with Gil Steinlauf, a rabbi from Washington, D.C., when the two were brought together as a part of an incubator for \u201cspiritual entrepreneurs\u201d at Columbia University\u2019s business school. \u201cI think people in tech who are creating new rituals really need to be in deep conversation with religious people like me,\u201d Steinlauf said in an interview, adding that it\u2019s all too rare to see a Silicon Valley entrepreneur learning from ancient religions. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people reinventing the wheel, and as a rabbi I kind of laugh sometimes. People say, \u2018Let\u2019s take Tuesday\u2014and basically make it Shabbat.\u2019 It\u2019s just funny. Why are you trying to do that when there are already synagogues and churches and all kinds of things that exist for that?\u201d In the next breath, the rabbi added: \u201cBut I understand it, of course. People are alienated from these structures.\u201d For a person who\u2019s walked away from institutionalized religion, it may be psychologically easier to join the National Day of Unplugging than to observe the Sabbath, the original 24-hour digital detox. On the other hand, turning to new rituals as stand-ins for ancient ones raises the tricky issue of legitimacy. Part of why an ancient ritual seems legitimate or authentic to many of us is because it is, well, ancient. Its validity is sourced from its perceived unchangingness\u2014\u201cMy great-great-grandparents did this the exact same way!\u201d\u2014and the way it binds us to a larger community of people, both dead and alive. Absent that antiquity, what makes a new ritual feel authentic? \u201cIn earlier generations, the more we could objectify religion as something that lives outside of you, the more authentic it was,\u201d Steinlauf said. \u201cNow, if you\u2019re really going to speak Millennial, ritual has to be fundamentally subjective in the sense that it has to be intensely personally meaningful and relevant. As soon as it speaks to my truth, that\u2019s authenticity\u2014that\u2019s how we define authenticity now.\u201d If the bespoke and the legitimate used to be inversely proportional, today they are directly proportional. Although this may be a reality of the 21st century, there are several downsides to it. For one, ancient rituals are technologies that have been debugged, fine-tuned, and time-tested over millennia. They evolved to respond to human needs, and in their crystallized form, they contain deep insights into those needs. By jettisoning the rituals, we also jettison the wisdom they house. \u201cOne of the great critiques of modern Millennial spirituality is that the sense of lineage is being utterly destroyed in this radical democratization of spiritual life that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Steinlauf said. \u201cYou lose something very precious when you obliterate lineage.\u201d To the rabbi, there\u2019s an even graver risk that comes with separating ritual from religion. \u201cWhen it\u2019s ensconced in religious life,\u201d he said, \u201critual doesn\u2019t just serve to validate your experience or to help you through a difficult moment.\u201d It also situates your experience within a larger framework of moral imperatives, and makes demands of you, including that you be of service to others. \u201cSomeone may say, \u2018I\u2019m just helping somebody who had a bad day at work to process and move on.\u2019 Well, okay, that could be effective\u2014but to what extent are you actually helping the ultimate job of all ritual life, which is to give you the message that it\u2019s not all about you? Rituals that are designed as one-offs for individuals are divorced from that\u2014and that\u2019s very dangerous.\u201d Finally, an endeavor like Ritual Design Lab has a paradox at its heart. If I contact the Ritual Design Hotline and the team solves my problem by creating a ritual for me, I am implicitly buying into the notion that I\u2019m not capable of creating one myself. By outsourcing ritual design, I am, to use Steinlauf\u2019s idiom, objectifying rather than subjectifying it; I\u2019m reinscribing the old notion that we have to look to outside experts for such things. Only now, instead of turning to a rabbi or a priest or a guru, I\u2019m turning to a designer. Ozenc does not necessarily see this as a problem. In the Stanford classes he co-taught with Hagan, he ran two sessions. In the first, each student designed a ritual for herself. In the second, students paired up: One, the designer, was tasked with crafting a ritual for the other, the client. \u201cThe second version is more effective because you might not be seeing the opportunities in your life\u2014maybe someone else can see better,\u201d Ozenc told me. \u201cThere\u2019s value in it if someone you trust comes in, and you give that other person permission to design a ritual for you.\u201d That, of course, is what religious people have been doing for millennia; it\u2019s just that the \u201cother person\u201d might have lived in the year 218, not 2018. Others who work in the ritual design world\u2014a community few in numbers, but growing on both sides of the Atlantic\u2014are vociferously opposed to outsourcing. \u201cOne should never outsource one\u2019s role as a ritual artisan. That is giving away one\u2019s power,\u201d said Jeltje Gordon-Lennox, a psychotherapist and ritual designer in Geneva, Switzerland. She is part of the European Ritual Network, a group that sprang up three years ago to bring together ritual designers in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands. \u201cWe are all able to craft our own rituals,\u201d she said. \u201cHumankind has always crafted ritual to mark special events, moments, and places. With the advent of urbanization, we became removed from this creative process as institutions took over. Consumerism reinforced our role as end-users.\u201d And consumerism is still very much at play. Gordon-Lennox offers a service that she calls \u201critual accompaniment.\u201d You can hire her to help you design a bespoke ceremony, like a funeral, but expect the process to be both expensive and collaborative. \u201cI charge a hefty rate for what I do,\u201d she told me bluntly. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve said this to clients: \u2018You\u2019re going to pay me rather a lot. And you\u2019re going to work really hard.\u2019\u201d Ritual Design Lab does not currently charge individuals when creating a ritual for them. \u201cMy intention isn\u2019t really to make this a business,\u201d Ozenc said. \u201cIt\u2019s more a statement\u2014that people need spirituality even if they don\u2019t necessarily want to be connected to any institutional religion.\u201d Nevertheless, asked if he plans to charge a fee one day, he said, \u201cNot for individuals, but maybe for rituals in organizations, we are thinking about that.\u201d For Steinlauf, the problem isn\u2019t so much with ritual designers making a living off people\u2019s spiritual needs\u2014rabbis do that too\u2014but with what happens to our ritual life in the process. Customization risks stripping ritual of lineage, and unbundling ritual from religion can produce a self-centered mentality instead of one in tune with broader moral imperatives. \u201cWe need to take a breath,\u201d the rabbi said, \u201cand think about the wider implications of commodifying our spiritual life this way.\u201d \n    Jeff VanderMeer discusses how writing fiction about environmental crises may jolt readers out of complacency.\n A recent spate of #MeToo stories serves as yet another reminder of the centrifugal forces of talented men. On Monday evening, The New Yorker published yet more proof that the #MeToo moment continues apace: a report containing the testimony of four women accusing the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, of a range of physical and emotional abuses. The story, under the powerhouse co-byline of Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow, was striking\u2014and nauseating\u2014for several reasons, among them allegations of hitting, of threatening, of racism. One of the other reasons, though, was this line: \u201cAfter the former girlfriend ended the relationship, she told several friends about the abuse. A number of them advised her to keep the story to herself, arguing that Schneiderman was too valuable a politician for the Democrats to lose.\u201d Kanye West wants freedom\u2014white freedom. I could only have seen it there, on the waxed hardwood floor of my elementary-school auditorium, because I was young then, barely 7 years old, and cable had not yet come to the city, and if it had, my father would not have believed in it. Yes, it had to have happened like this, like folk wisdom, because when I think of that era, I do not think of MTV, but of the futile attempt to stay awake and navigate the yawning whiteness of Friday Night Videos, and I remember that there were no VCRs among us then, and so it would have had to have been there that I saw it, in the auditorium that adjoined the cafeteria, where after the daily serving of tater tots and chocolate milk, a curtain divider was pulled back and all the kids stormed the stage. And I would have been there among them, awkwardly uprocking, or worming in place, or stiffly snaking, or back-spinning like a broken rotor, and I would have looked up and seen a kid, slightly older, facing me, smiling to himself, then moving across the floor by popping up alternating heels, gliding in reverse, walking on the moon. The new music video from Childish Gambino weaponizes the viewer\u2019s instinctive bodily empathy. \u201cThis Is America\u201d isn\u2019t the first time that Donald Glover, as his musical alter ego Childish Gambino, has harnessed dance in service of surrealism. But the art form has a conspicuous symbolic significance in the artist\u2019s latest single, which Glover debuted on Saturday Night Live: The song\u2019s emphasis on dance was apparent in his live performance on the show, in the cover art for the track, and in the remarkable music video itself, which has more than 36 million views on YouTube as of publication. In the video, a grinning, shirtless Glover dances through a giant warehouse, occasionally accompanied by black school children in uniform, as chaotic scenes of violence unfold behind him\u2014and are sometimes enacted by him. Some researchers believe that the microbiome may play a role in regulating how people think and feel. By now, the idea that gut bacteria affect a person\u2019s health is not revolutionary. Many people know that these microbes influence digestion, allergies, and metabolism. The trend has become almost commonplace: New books appear regularly detailing precisely which diet will lead to optimum bacterial health. But these microbes\u2019 reach may extend much further, into the human brains. A growing group of researchers around the world are investigating how the microbiome, as this bacterial ecosystem is known, regulates how people think and feel. Scientists have found evidence that this assemblage\u2014about a thousand different species of bacteria, trillions of cells that together weigh between one and three pounds\u2014could play a crucial role in autism, anxiety, depression, and other disorders.

In black leather decorated with metal studs, they play a pounding style of music that people who know more than me trace to the British band \u201cVenom\u201d and its 1981 album Welcome to Hell. Question: Is this cultural appropriation? Why or why not? The question is inspired by a spasm of social-media cruelty that caught wide attention last week. A young woman in Utah bought a Chinese-style dress to wear to her high school formal. She posted some photographs of herself on her personal Instagram page\u2014and suddenly found herself the target of virulent online abuse. For once, the story has a happy ending. Good sense and kindness prevailed, and instead of her prom being ruined, the young woman exited the dance buoyed by worldwide support and affirmation, most of all from within China. Every year, more than 400,000 crabs are bled for the miraculous medical substance that flows through their bodies\u2014now pharmaceutical companies are finally committing to an alternative that doesn't harm animals. Horseshoe crabs are sometimes called \u201cliving fossils\u201d because they have been around in some form for more than 450 million years. In this time, the Earth has gone through multiple major ice ages, a Great Dying, the formation and subsequent breaking up of Pangaea, and an asteroid impact that killed the dinosaurs and most of life on Earth yet again. In other words, horseshoe crabs have truly seen some shit. Yet, I would conjecture, some of their strangest experiences must have come in just the past few decades, as one of the soft-bodied mammals that came after dinosaurs began using their hands to scoop horseshoe crabs out of the ocean en masse. Contemporary humans do not deliberately kill the horseshoe crabs\u2014as did previous centuries of farmers catching them for fertilizer or fishermen using them as bait. Instead, they scrub the crabs clean of barnacles, fold their hinged carapaces, and stick stainless steel needles into a soft, weak spot, in order to draw blood. Horseshoe crab blood runs blue and opaque, like antifreeze mixed with milk. The talk-radio host\u2019s willingness to indulge the fantasy of a mob marching on D.C. to oust Robert Mueller can be called many things\u2014but not \u201cconservative.\u201d Talk radio\u2019s Rush Limbaugh delighted at the expansive twists and turns of the independent counsel investigation of Bill Clinton, cheering it all the way to impeachment, despite polls suggesting Americans wanted Congress to censure the president and move on. He met Barack Obama\u2019s election by declaring that he wanted him to fail, then allied with men who tried to discredit Obama by falsely stating he was born abroad. But now that the nation\u2019s leading birther, Donald Trump, is in the White House, Limbaugh purports to be outraged by what he calls efforts to undermine and unseat a duly elected president. In recent segments on his show, he has claimed that Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation is \u201cactually a cover-up for all of the things the Obama administration and the Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee engaged in to try to taint the election,\u201d and additionally, that \u201cif these people don\u2019t like the way you voted, they\u2019re gonna just throw it out. They\u2019re gonna do whatever they can to undermine it and sabotage it, \u2019cause they don\u2019t like the result.\u201d Marchers from last year\u2019s Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville who attacked a black counter-protester made a claim that has often worked for police officers: They acted in self-defense. The photographs of the beating show DeAndre Harris curled up in a ball on the floor of a parking lot trying to protect his face and body as the men around him, some armed with boards or pipes, strike him repeatedly. The men beating Harris were there to attend the white-nationalist rally in Charlottesville last August, where one counter-protester, Heather Heyer, was killed when a car drove into the crowd. Harris, who survived the beating with eight staples in his skull, might have been the second. To an uninformed observer, the picture may look like an image of mob violence. But to many of the men beating Harris and their attorneys, it shows something else: Men acting in self defense. \u201cTo be honest, I was terrified,\u201d Jacob Scott Goodwin, one of the men arrested for beating Harris told the jury during his trial. \u201cI\u2019d probably perish or be sent to the hospital and be terribly hurt.\u201d Seth Meyers on Saturday Night Live, Obama, Oprah 2020, and whether media elites try too hard to feel the pain of Trump voters In 2011, the comedian Seth Meyers, then the head writer for Saturday Night Live and host of the show\u2019s \u201cWeekend Update\u201d news roundup, mocked Donald Trump at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner. \u201cDonald Trump has been saying that he will run for president as a Republican,\u201d Meyers said, as Trump sat stone-faced in the audience, \u201cwhich is surprising, since I just assumed he was running as a joke.\u201d That same evening, President Barack Obama roasted Trump at length. The evening\u2019s jokes\u2014and the idea that they spurred Trump to run in 2016\u2014have become Washington lore. Meyers, who since 2014 has hosted Late Night on NBC, still refuses to pull any punches where Trump is concerned. In January, he hosted the Golden Globes and, in a clear callback to his 2011 mockery of Trump\u2019s presidential ambitions, winkingly berated Oprah Winfrey, telling her that she doesn\u2019t have what it takes to be president. What happens when a Pakistani American writer goes deep into the West Bank? I was here to report on Jewish settlers, the 600,000 citizens of Israel living beyond its pre-1967 borders. My main concern was whether the normally guarded and cautious settler community would open up and talk to me: a brown-skinned, practicing Muslim from the United States. I. The Old City Should I lie to an Israeli soldier in order to be allowed to pray? This was a theological dilemma I never studied in Sunday school, one I never thought I would have to confront. Anxious and on edge, the soldier was standing in front of me, rifle in hand, blocking my way, and all I had to do was tell him I was 50 years old, and then I could pray at one of Islam\u2019s holiest sites.
