[{"by":"bill38","descendants":2,"id":17038654,"kids":"[17038807, 17038819]","score":14,"text":" A familiar 12-hour, six-day-a-week working schedule in China powered by unpaid overtime is under threat \u2013 ambitious millennials have had enough. Glitzy nightlife, museums, live concerts \u2013 Shanghai promises everything that attracts young professionals to an expensive city. But Li Zhepeng, a 25-year-old who arrived from China\u2019s heartland, wasn\u2019t able to enjoy any of it. Instead, he spent his time at the office working. He would clock in at 9am, after a 90-minute commute to the outer suburbs where his e-commerce firm rented cheap office space, and usually left well after 8pm. \u201cSometimes, there was no reason for the long hours \u2013 it was just the whole work culture,\u201d Li says. The young professional was expected to stick to a grueling work schedule that has become so pervasive in Chinese companies that it\u2019s now commonly referred to as 996: working from nine in the morning to nine in the evening, six days a week. Refusing the 12-hour workday As a low-level employee at an e-commerce site, Li was tasked with posting descriptions of toys and backpacks. He was even expected to work on Sundays, when he\u2019d reply to questions from customers from Australia, Europe or the US from home.  For that, Li received a salary of 3,500 yuan a month, or about $560 (\u00a3406). That\u2019s less than half of the monthly rental cost of a one-bedroom apartment outside the city centre, and so he\u2019s sharing a small apartment with three flatmates. Li said that initially he felt he couldn\u2019t be too be picky: he had majored in English, not in one of the sought-after science or technology fields, and he had attended a low-ranked university. Many of his friends are unemployed. But he nonetheless then became part of a phenomenon that experts have started to notice \u2013 young professionals pushing back against employers who expect them to work around the clock.\u00a0  At the forefront are millennials who are often better educated, more aware of their rights and more interested in finding something fulfilling than the previous generation  At the forefront are millennials who are often better educated, more aware of their rights and more interested in finding something fulfilling than the previous generation. And as only children (China\u2019s one-child policy wasn\u2019t eased until 2015), they are also outspoken and pampered. \u201cIn my experience young people, especially the post-90s generation, are reluctant to work overtime \u2013 they are more self-centered,\u201d says labour rights expert Li Jupeng, one of many who have observed some millennials challenging the 996 concept. The relative affluence of their parents and grandparents is part of the reason. China\u2019s rapid economic transformation has given rise to a sizeable middle class, with almost 70% of the country\u2019s urban population making between $9,000 and $34,000 annually in 2012. In 2000, that figure was just 4%. As only children, millennials are receiving a lot of support from their families \u2013 including a financial safety net should their careers not go as planned. Although their options for pushing back are limited, some are no longer willing to put in long hours for a meagre paycheck. Legal dangers Li, for example, decided quickly that he hadn\u2019t come to Shanghai to spend every waking hour in an office or commuting. \u201cYou work around the clock, and you get very, very tired,\u201d Li says. \u201cBut if you complain, they say you can just go and find another job.\u201d After just 20 days on the job, he resigned. In some cases, young workers have sued their employers. That\u2019s according to a report by Zhang Xiaolin, a senior legal counsel at Wusong Network Technology (a Beijing-based law consulting company) and venture capital firm China Growth Capital.  It\u2019s not just the hours, but also the pay  \u201cTheoretically, a 996 work schedule is against the law,\u201d she says. Companies may apply for special permission to adopt a 996 schedule if their business warrants it. Pilots or train conductors, for example, can work longer shifts than the eight hours stipulated under Chinese law. But e-commerce businesses like the one Li was working for do not qualify. \u201cSo even if these companies try to apply for such working hours, most of them would not get approval from the labour administration,\u201d Zhang says. In legal disputes, that can put the employee at an advantage. It\u2019s not just the hours, but also the pay \u2013 more than 40% of start-ups they interviewed did not have a clear compensation scheme for overtime, she added. In his second job, also at an e-commerce firm, Li was more self-confident. He spoke to his boss, asked for a more manageable workload and to leave on time every once in a while. She agreed. To most of his colleagues, speaking up was a brave move. \u201cThey said I was their idol,\u201d he says.  The birth of a punishing schedule There are historical reasons behind the emergence of the 996 culture. When China\u2019s tech and start-up scene started to flourish in the early 2000s, most companies sought employees willing to work around the clock, something which helped some of them grow into the country\u2019s biggest companies. Tech company Tencent, for example, is among the world\u2019s five most valuable firms. \u201cFor the last 10 or 15 years, the work culture has been extremely intense,\u201d said William Bao Bean, a venture capitalist and the managing director of start-up accelerator Chinaccelerator. And because China\u2019s tech companies, who were among the first adopters of unpaid overtime, are now the largest employers, companies in other fields have also started to make their staffs work longer hours in a bid to match their success. The normalisation of unpaid overtime led to the invention of the phrase 996 \u2013 but Bao Bean says the very existence of the phrase is also a sign that attitudes might be changing.  China has moved from a society that was told what to do, to one that is doing what it wants to \u2013 William Bao Bean  \u201cThe fact that there is now a word for it and that we are having a conversation about this shows that the market is maturing,\u201d he says. However, Bao Bean says that people who like their work environments are not grumbling about the hours. Companies who inspire their employees offer good compensation packages and that are prestigious can find people to work 996 without complaint, he says. \u201cChina has moved from a society that was told what to do, to one that is doing what it wants to, and that\u2019s also a millennial thing,\u201d he says. Software developer Johnson Wu works six days a week, about half of them on nine to nine schedule \u2013 not more than any other company would expect him to work. Often he gets home too late to put his child to bed and he hasn\u2019t watched a TV series in years. But his employer is Huawei, China\u2019s biggest tech company by revenue, which has been growing faster than mobile phone competitor Apple. The pay is good and his company\u2019s name is well respected. When he introduces himself as a staffer, people nod in recognition. Li is trying to find something similar \u2013 a meaningful job, better pay perhaps or at least the chance for more professional development. He left his second job after about three months despite his negotiating success. The job, he said, didn\u2019t make him happy and he didn\u2019t get along with his boss. He\u2019s living off his meagre savings and says that his parents have offered to support him financially while he figures out what to do with his life. At the moment, he\u2019s interviewing for a job with a travel company in Fiji. And in the meantime, he says: \u201cI\u2019m just going to relax.\u201d -- To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.

When the Washington police opened solicitations, the only bidder, Draeger, a German medical technology maker, won the contract to sell its flagship device, the Alcotest 9510, across the state.  \t \tBut defense attorneys have long believed the breathalyzer is faulty.  \t \tJason Lantz, a Washington-based defense lawyer, enlisted a software engineer and a security researcher to examine its source code. The two experts wrote in a preliminary report that they found flaws capable of producing incorrect breath test results. The defense hailed the results as a breakthrough, believing the findings could cast doubt on countless drunk-driving prosecutions.  \t \tThe two distributed their early findings to attendees at a conference for defense lawyers, which Draeger said was in violation of a court-signed protective order the experts had agreed to, and the company threatened to sue.  \t \tTheir research was left unfinished, and a final report was never completed.  \t \tDraeger said in a statement the company was protecting its source code and intellectual property, not muzzling research.  \t \t\"Pursuant to a protective order, Draeger provided the source code to both of the defense experts in Snohomish County,\" said Marion Varec, a spokesperson for Draeger. \"That source code is highly proprietary and it was important to Draeger that the protective order limit its use to the purposes of the litigation at issue.\" Draeger says it believes that one of the experts entrusted to examine the source code was using it in violation of the protective order, so Draeger sent the expert a cease and desist letter. Draeger says it \"worked with the expert to resolve the issue.\"  \t \tOf the law firms we spoke to that were at the conference and received the report, none knew of Draeger's threat to launch legal action. A person with a copy of the report allowed ZDNet to read it.  \t \tThe breathalyzer has become a staple in law enforcement, with more than a million Americans arrested each year for driving under the influence of alcohol -- an offense known as a DUI. Drunk driving has its own economy: A multi-billion dollar business for lawyers, state governments, and the breathalyzer manufacturers -- all of which have a commercial stake at play.  \t \tYet, the case in Washington is only the latest in several legal battles where the breathalyzer has faced scrutiny about the technology used to secure convictions.  \t \tWhen one Washington state driver accused of drunk-driving in 2015 disputed the reading, his defense counsel petitioned the court to obtain the device's source code from Draeger.  \t \tLantz, who was leading the legal effort to review the Alcotest 9510 in the state, hired two software engineers, Falcon Momot, a security consultant, and Robert Walker, a software engineer and decade-long Microsoft veteran, who were tasked with examining the code. The code was obtained under a court-signed protective order, putting strict controls on Momot and Walker to protect the source code, though the order permitted the researchers to report their findings, with some limitations. Although the researchers were not given a device, the researchers were given a binary file containing the state's configuration set by Washington State Patrol.  \t \tAlthough their findings had yet to be verified against one of the breathalyzers, their preliminary report outlined several issues in the code that they said could impact the outcome of an alcohol breath test. A Draeger Alcotest 9510 device, with a reading in German. (Image: NunspeetOost\/Twitter)    \tIn order to produce a result, the Alcotest 9510 uses two sensors to measure alcohol content in a breath sample: An infrared beam that measures how much light goes through the breath, and a fuel cell that measures the electrical current of the sample. The results should be about the same and within a small margin of error -- usually within a thousandth of a decimal point. If the results are too far apart, the test will be rejected.   \tBut the report said that under some conditions the breathalyzer can return an inflated reading -- a result that could also push a person over the legal limit.   \tOne attorney, who read the report, said they believed the report showed the breathalyzer \"tipped the scales\" in favor of prosecutors, and against drivers.   \tOne section in the report raised issue with a lack of adjustment of a person's breath temperature.   \tBreath temperature can fluctuate throughout the day, but, according to the report, can also wildly change the results of an alcohol breath test. Without correction, a single digit over a normal breath temperature of 34 degrees centigrade can inflate the results by six percent -- enough to push a person over the limit.   \tThe quadratic formula set by the Washington State Patrol should correct the breath temperature to prevent false results. The quadratic formula corrects warmer breath downward, said the report, but the code doesn't explain how the corrections are made. The corrections \"may be insufficient\" if the formula is faulty, the report added.   \tIssues with the code notwithstanding, Washington chose not to install a component to measure breath temperature, according to testimony in a 2015 hearing, and later confirmed by Draeger.   \tKyle Moore, a spokesperson for Washington State Patrol said the police department \"tested and approved the instrument that best fit our business needs,\" and believes the device can produce accurate results without the breath temperature sensor.   \tThe code is also meant to check to ensure the device is operating within a certain temperature range set by Draeger, because the device can produce incorrect results if it's too hot or too cold.   \tBut the report said a check meant to measure the ambient temperature was disabled in the state configuration.   \t\"The unit could record a result even when outside of its operational requirements,\" said the report. If the breathalyzer was too warm, the printed-out results would give no indication the test might be invalid, the report said.   \tDraeger disputed this finding. A spokesperson said the Washington devices check their temperature, the check is enabled, and that the devices will not produce a reading while the device is outside its operational temperature range.   \tWhen asked, a Washington State Patrol spokesperson would not say if the breathalyzer was configured to allow breath tests outside its operational temperature range, saying only that the device \"has been tested and validated in various ambient temperatures.\"   \tThe report also scrutinized the other sensor -- the fuel cell -- used to measure a person's alcohol levels. Any fuel cell will degrade over time -- more so when the breathalyzer is used often. This decay can alter the accuracy of test results. The code is meant to adjust the results to balance out the fuel cell's decline, but the report said the correction is flawed. Breathalyzers should be re-calibrated every year, but the state's configuration limits those adjustments only to the first six months, the report added.   \t\"We also note that the calibration age does not account for the use frequency of conditions; a unit that has been used hundreds of times per day would have the same correction as one used only once or twice in several months,\" the report said.   \tConcluding the nine-page report, the researchers say they are \"skeptical\" that the Alcotest 9510 can produce a reliable measurement of breath alcohol.   \t\"Although the apparatus states its output in very absolute terms, we recommend interpreting the results with extreme caution,\" the report said.   \tAlthough Momot and Walker's code review was limited to devices in Washington, similar concerns dragged other states into protracted legal battles, forcing prosecutors to defend not only the breathalyzer but also how it's configured.   \tBut the line between Draeger's source code and each state's configuration is blurry, making it difficult to know who is responsible for incorrect results.   \tDraeger said in an email that the \"calibration and adjustment procedures depend on the instrument, additional equipment and materials, and the persons performing these procedures.\" When asked about the guardrails put in place to prevent calibration errors, the company said, \"only trained and certified personnel perform special instrument certification procedures.\"   \tWashington State Patrol said the device produces accurate results, even without certain sensors installed. \n\n                        US government pushed tech firms to hand over source code\n                    \n If source code gets into the wrong hands, the damage would be incalculable. \nRead More\n   \tDraeger's breathalyzer is widely used across the US, including in California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York. It's often the only breathalyzer used in the states where they were bought.   \tIn both New Jersey and Massachusetts, defense lawyers raised concerns. By acquiring the devices used by the states, lawyers commissioned engineers to analyze the code who say they found flaws that they say could produce incorrect results.   \tBut defense teams in both states largely failed to stop their state governments from using the devices, public records show.   \tNew Jersey's top court found in 2008 that a similar Alcotest breathalyzer -- said to use the same underlying algorithms as the Alcotest 9510 -- was \"generally scientifically reliable\" and can be used with some configuration changes. One such change was to adjust the breathalyzer's results for women over age 60 -- who often aren't able to produce the minimum breath volume of 1.5 liters required for a test. But defense lawyers argued that these changes were never put into place.   \tThe same court ruled five years later that the breathalyzer \"remains scientifically reliable, and generates results that are admissible\" in court.   \tIn nearby Massachusetts, a scandal that blew up in 2017 involving alleged failings in the breathalyzer threw thousands of prosecutions into disarray, because \"all but two of the 392 machines\" examined in the state had not been properly calibrated.   \tA district judge ruled that breath test results from miscalibrated devices for two years prior to September 2014 were \"presumptively unreliable,\" said Joe Bernard, a defense attorney who led the case against the Alcotest 9510 in Massachusetts.   \tBernard, and his colleague Tom Workman, a computer forensic expert who later trained as a lawyer and consulted on the case, obtained the state's source code and produced a report.   \tIn a phone call, Workman criticized the Draeger breathalyzer, arguing that it can produce widely inflated results. One section of his report claimed the device had a litany of programming errors, including code that -- like in Washington -- apparently fails to correct for fuel cell fatigue.   \tBut the court rejected the findings and found the source code still produced sound scientific results.   \tWhile legal battles were ongoing, Washington waited to push ahead with its deployment, but the ruling in New Jersey case in 2008 was seen as a vote of confidence.   \tAlmost a year later, Washington State Patrol's toxicologist said in an email  seen by ZDNet that the police department should \"throw caution to the wind\" to deploy the device to police officers across the state without commissioning an independent source code evaluation -- though she recommended confirming with the chief of police.   \tWhen asked whether an independent evaluation was ever commissioned, a Washington State Patrol spokesperson would not comment further and referred back to the legal filings in the case. A later email in 2015 confirmed that the Washington State Patrol' \"never commissioned\" an independent evaluation.   \tMoses Garcia, a former Washington state prosecutor who now works for a non-profit providing local governments in the state with legal advice, said in an email that the earlier breathalyzer in the New Jersey case had already been deemed admissible, and that the newer Alcotest 9510 uses the \"same basic algorithms and formulas\" as its predecessor.   \tThe former prosecutor criticized the defense's discovery effort as \"speculation.\"   \t\"In adopting and approving the [Alcotest 9510], the Washington breath alcohol program exceeds, by far, the scientific standards accepted in the scientific community for breath test instrument validation,\" he said.   \tFive years after the contract was signed, Washington State Patrol began deploying hundreds of Draeger breathalyzers in 2014 -- sparking interest from defense attorneys in the state.   \tNot long after, defense attorneys in the state sought access to the devices.   \tLantz was granted access to the source code used for Momot and Walker's code review by a local county court. In one of several recent phone calls with ZDNet, he recounted how he set out to see if there were problems with the state's device.   \t\"We thought we would find something but nothing like this,\" he said.   \tHundreds of DUI lawyers descended on Las Vegas in mid-2017 for their annual gathering.   \tAt the event, the two researchers shared their findings, which claimed the Alcotest 9510 having a \"defective design.\"   \tWord spread quickly. Draeger sent the researchers a cease and desist letter claiming defamation and alleging the two violated a protective order, designed to protect the source code from leaking.   \tDraeger and the researchers settled before a case was filed in court, avoiding any protracted legal battle. A legal case disputing the fine print of the order could have taken years to resolve.   \tDraeger said it \"remains willing to provide the source code for use in other litigation in Washington, so long as a proper protective order is in place.\"   \tBeyond a tweet by Walker pointing to a settlement statement on his site, there was little to indicate there had been any legal action against the pair.   \tThe statement said that the two experts \"never intended to violate the protective order\" and denied any wrongdoing. But the two sides \"agree\" the draft report was based on incomplete data and not finished -- and that \"no one in possession of the report should rely on it for any purpose.\"   \tWe reached out to Walker with questions, but he referred only to the settlement statement on his company's website, and he declined to comment further.   \tDraeger would not say why the settlement did not include a retraction on the report's findings.   \t\"There has not been an evidentiary hearing in Washington. If and when there is one, Draeger will cooperate fully,\" a spokesperson said.   \tBut Lantz paints a different picture. The defense attorney said he believes there \"really was no technical violation of the protective order,\" because the report didn't disclose any source code.   \t\"I do believe that [Draeger] is trying to interpret the protective order to be something that it's not,\" he said. \"If we could go back in time, I would've asked that the report was not handed out -- just because of the optics of it.\"   \tLantz said the protective order is vague, but contends it was framed to prevent the researchers from using the source code or their findings for commercial gain -- effectively preventing Momot and Walker from using their knowledge to build their own competing devices. He believes the order gives Draeger near complete control over the code and anything the company deems \"protected\" information.   \tThat's when Draeger \"began developing a strategy on how to block\" the researchers' report, said Lantz, because the company didn't want the \"pervasive exposure of these flaws.\"   \t\"I believe that interest of Draeger's to protect their bottom line overlaps with the state's interest to keep juries from hearing this information about the problems,\" he said.   \tDraeger maintained that it is protecting its intellectual property. The company said in response that it \"takes very seriously the proprietary nature of its source code,\" and \"protects proprietary information as a sound business practice,\" which can include various types of communications or agreements for a particular matter.   \tMomot and Walker are no longer involved with the case, but Sam Felton, a Washington-based software engineer, is set to conduct another review of the Alcotest 9510 code. When contacted, Felton would not speak in specifics about his findings to date, citing his own protective order, except that he found things in the code that caused him \"to have concerns.\"   \tAnd Lantz, now at a new law firm, is working on starting discovery proceedings in neighboring King County, home of Seattle, the largest city in the state. \n\n                        Contact me securely\n                    \n Zack Whittaker can be reached securely on Signal and WhatsApp at 646-755\u20138849, and his PGP fingerprint for email is: 4D0E 92F2 E36A EC51 DAAE 5D97 CB8C 15FA EB6C EEA5. \nRead More\n Security Apple kicks out iOS apps that share location data without asking you first Security LG resolves keyboard vulnerabilities which allow remote code execution attacks Security Firefox 60 lands: It's world's first browser to give you password-free logins, says Mozilla Banking \u200bAustralia to force 'big four' to open banking data by July 2019 Amazon Dog owner emails Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos after their dog went missing Security Major firms are failing to learn from Equifax breach Mobility Google patching out app monitor in Android P Security NEC facial recognition racked up 2,200 false positives at 2017 Champions League Final \u00a9 2018 CBS Interactive.

I just want to thank everyone for supporting this project. Thank you for all the charity suggestions, many of which were funded. Thank you for all the positive messages and love sent my way. And also, thank you, the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency community, for turning a Sourceforge project into a $0.5T industry. I kind of miss the old times when bitcoin was a small community, and you could count the number of 'altcoins' with one hand. Finding someone else who even knows about bitcoin was incredibly rare, and exchanges were semi-automated or running on PHP. Every development since then makes Bitcoin stronger and better at solving the problems of the existing financial system. It's created a new generation of crypto early adopters, cypherpunks or technologists using cryptography to change the world; and now having the power and responsibility of capital. 5104 BTC was turned into $55 million for charities, from providing clean water to clinical trials of MDMA as treatment for PTSD.  Thanks for following along with this experiment. I'm going to say goodbye now, but maybe there's room for dessert in a few years. If you're ever blessed with crypto fortune, consider supporting what you aspire our world to be. :) \u2665, Pine Post a comment!

They\u2019re vital to daily life. After two hours of mountain hiking, my first destination came into sight, and it hardly seemed worth the trip. The wooden shelter was barely noticeable in the mist, but when I slid open the door, all doubts disappeared. A tiny blue cable car was waiting inside, it seemed, just for me. I settled inside the vehicle, and picked up a clunky phone attached to the wall. Through the static I heard a woman\u2019s faint voice answer in German. \u201cHi,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019d like a ride down,\u201d wondering if this was really going to work. My answer came 20 seconds later, as machinery buzzed to life and the car glided out of the open side of the shack, floating above a spruce forest and looking out over emerald-green pastures. I felt like a feather slowly descending to Earth.  You may also be interested in:\u2022\u00a0What\u2019s in London\u2019s secret green huts?\u2022\u00a0An entire village built on rooftops\u2022\u00a0Where houses are made out of diamonds To the farming families of the Engelberg Valley region, which lies about 35km south of Lucerne in the Swiss cantons of Nidwalden and Obwalden, cable cars aren\u2019t built for ski holidays and scenic views. They\u2019re basic transportation, used to haul supplies and run errands. But the Buir\u00e4b\u00e4hnli (German for \u2018farmers cableways\u2019), which are concentrated in the region, also welcome hikers, who can pay a small fee to hop aboard, like an Uber of the Alps. \u201cWe call this the Valley of the Cable Cars,\u201d said Linda Schmitter, 22, who uses one of her family\u2019s small gondolas on her work commute to Engelberg. Her family runs a dairy farm in the hills above the village of Wolfenschiessen, and two dormitory-style mountain huts, offering room and board to visitors like me. I met her after a day of hiking that had included four cable-car rides zig-zagging up and down the Engelberger Aa River valley. Linda\u2019s father, Ueli Schmitter, a third-generation farmer, helps neighbours keep their gondolas in proper repair. The cableways must pass an annual government inspection, and every five years undergo a complete safety assessment, using X-rays to reveal stresses to cars and cables. Ueli\u00a0admits to an obsession with the vehicles. \u201cI pimp my cable car,\u201d he said in heavily accented English. \u201cI clean it every evening. I say to it \u2018I love you\u2019.\u201d  Although the family\u2019s cars are 38 years old, they look brand new, with gleaming royal blue and lime-green paint jobs and a playful decal of a cow hanging from a cable car on the door. It\u2019s not artistic license: occasionally Ueli attaches a basket to the bottom of his cars to transport his small-sized Dexter cattle down to the valley. Farmer cableways developed after World War I as an efficient way to bring supplies to high Alpine fields and a cheaper alternative to building roads. Because of the hilly topography and reliance on agriculture, many developed in the canton of Nidwalden, which boasts one of the highest concentrations of cableways in the world. They\u2019re particularly prominent in the Engelberg area, which has a third of the country\u2019s remaining farmer\u2019s cableways. The cableways soon became quasi-public, with neighbours sharing them for deliveries and transportation. Eventually some were opened to hikers, who would pay owners a small fee for rides. But since it was difficult for visitors to learn details and plan outings, in 2016 the local tourist board began promoting a package ticket for a multi-day hike using cars around the Engelberger Aa River valley.  For me, it\u2019s natural: when I go outside for work, for school, for anything, I take a cable car  It was that hike that led me the next morning to the compact village of Oberrickenbach, where three cable cars promised an easy ascent to the looming peaks. Two were commercial operations, but my ride was hidden around the corner, where a farmer lifted bales of hay onto a platform hanging from a cable. When I requested a lift, he stepped inside a storage shed to press a button, and a second cable started to move. A few minutes later, a faded red vehicle glided into view. Again, I clambered aboard and a few minutes later found the farmer\u2019s son, Daniel Durrer, unloading the hay his father had just sent up. Durrer, who had taken a day off from his job as a chef, grew up with aerial transportation. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s natural. When I go outside for work, for school, for anything, I take a cable car,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was a child, I used one every day.\u201d  This stop was only a waystation. After a few minutes of chatting, he pointed to an open-air vehicle that looked like a cable-car version of an antique pickup truck, with an open bed ringed with removable wooden guards. I piled in, and as the vehicle began to climb, Durrer waved goodbye. At the top of the hill, a winding forest path led to a cheesemaker\u2019s rustic studio and cafe, where owner Barbara Wismer seemed eager for company. She served a plate of nutty, creamy cheeses and freshly baked bread, and recalled how she left her banking job in Z\u00fcrich to join her boyfriend. They live here from spring through autumn, and generate electricity with a wood-burning stove. Supplies come up by cable car. It\u2019s a simple life, but one under threat. In the last 10 years, the Engelberg Valley has seen the number of cableways drop from about 100 to just more than 40 as the government began to remove cable cars from communities served by roads, Ueli Schmitter told me. The lines crisscrossing the valley were deemed a hazard to helicopters and paragliders, and expensive to regulate.  Progress maybe. However, early in the trip I had seen why locals want to keep them. Walking down the valley floor the previous day, I\u2019d spotted a blue, four-seater gondola attached to cables leading up a mountain. It looked too enticing to pass up, so I hopped aboard. I was greeted by a couple, their two grandchildren and a dog who were waiting for the cable car at the top of the ridge. My plan had been to turn around and take the car with them back down to the valley floor, but the family suggested I might enjoy trying another gondola 20 minutes along the ridge path, and pointed the way. Eventually I found the second cableway \u00ad\u2013 and a cryptic handwritten sign with bright red letters scrawled across the top. \u2018Achtung!\u2019 it read, followed by a brief note. After a moment, its meaning sank in. The line was closed for repairs. My destination, Wolfenschiessen, lay nearly 365m below. I was going to have to walk. A path led across a field, and suddenly corkscrewed down a deep gorge. It was getting dark and starting to rain, and the trail grew rocky, steep and slick, forcing me to grab at tree limbs to slow my descent. Experience Engelberg's cable cars The Engelberg-Titlus tourism bureau has designed a three-day hike called the Buir\u00e4b\u00e4hnli Safari using privately owned cableways. The hike, which takes around 20 hours and includes two overnight stops, starts and finishes at Engelberg railway station. Shorter hikes can also be planned easily. When I finally arrived on the valley floor, I was muddy and soaking wet. What would have been a five-minute ride had taken nearly an hour. And like the farmer Schmitter, I was ready to declare my love for a cable car.

Ubuntu 18.04 is a Long Term Support (LTS) release and will receive updates and support from Canonical until April 2023. But more notably... Unity is gone. GNOME is back. And Ubuntu has never been better. The demise of the company's Unity desktop, which Canonical abandoned to focus on its work for server and IoT systems, comes nearly seven years after it first replaced GNOME 2. While the Unity user interface was very much a love it or hate it experience, it was (for better or worse) the thing that defined Ubuntu for nearly the past decade. You might think the end of Unity would leave Ubuntu rudderless and drifting, but I'd argue it has done just the opposite.Further ReadingUbuntu Unity is dead: Desktop will switch back to GNOME next year Bionic Beaver marks the first time LTS release users get a look at Ubuntu's new GNOME-based desktop. And for the first time in quite a while, Ubuntu feels like a distro that is firing on all cylinders, turning out what might be its strongest release ever, in an LTS package no less. Not only is 18.04 well worth the upgrade\u2014especially for those coming all the way from the last LTS release (16.04)\u2014it's worth checking out even if you use a completely different distro. If you've been using last autumn's 17.10 release, you're already familiar with the new, slightly customized version of GNOME arriving to replace Ubuntu's Unity desktop. That said, 17.10 was very much a test release, one that had some serious hiccups thanks to an installer bug that wiped out some hardware. With 18.04, the testing is over and polish has been applied (and in some cases things have reverted back to even stabler options). In my several months of testing throughout the beta release cycle, 18.04 has performed rock solid. Further ReadingUbuntu 17.10: Return of the GNOMEWhile much of the work for this release has gone into the transition from Unity to GNOME and making sure that's a smooth experience for desktop users, that's far from the only story here. In fact, that effort isn't even the most interesting part of what's new in 18.04. Much of what's great in this release isn't aimed at the desktop. Rather, server users deploying Ubuntu on any one of the major cloud platforms will really enjoy this latest iteration. That reality might be a little disconcerting to desktop users, many of whom are already convinced Ubuntu is going to abandon the desktop in favor of the more profitable worlds of server and IoT, but I don't think that's the case. If nothing else, Canonical knows developers need a solid desktop on which to do their work, so Ubuntu is unlikely to get rid of its desktop just because it's less profitable. While it's purely anecdotal, most developers I've met and worked with who used Ubuntu did so because they got used to it on a server first. That's why it makes sense of Canonical to focus on servers: not only is it where the money is, it's where a good portion of its desktop users is coming from. Even if the desktop became a purely communally driven project with very little input from Canonical\u2014which, again, I don't see happening, but hypothetically\u2014I think it's in a better position to survive, even thrive, with its new GNOME interface than with Unity. GNOME certainly isn't going anywhere, and while Canonical has already started contributing upstream, the bulk of the work being done is well outside Canonical's influence. By comparison, Unity was solely the work of Canonical developers. So the short story is Unity is gone, but there's no need to panic. Not only is the transition to GNOME pretty smooth thanks to Canonical's tweaks to GNOME Shell, there are plenty of other flavors of Ubuntu out there to choose from. There are, in fact, seven official flavors of Ubuntu, most of which offer an LTS release (though in the case of flavors, LTS usually means three years, not five). We'll look closer at several flavors of Ubuntu, but first it's time to reflect on the new default GNOME most users will see. For those upgrading from the last LTS release, you're in for something of a shock. This is without a doubt the single biggest change in an Ubuntu release since Canonical dumped GNOME 2 for Unity. Nearly every part of Ubuntu 18.04 has changed, been improved, or is completely new compared to 16.04. There's a new desktop, a new lock screen, some new default apps, and (of course) a new kernel under the hood.Further ReadingA first look at Ubuntu 18.04 LTS desktop I'll start with the most immediately obvious change, the new GNOME desktop. I won't sugar coat it; the most challenging part of the transition to GNOME will be potential changes in workflows that will happen because of differences between Unity and GNOME. That said, the change is surprisingly easy to make in most cases. Ubuntu's developers have done an impressive job of styling GNOME to match Unity in looks, if not entirely in function. To help users transition from previous releases, Canonical has created a little \"first-run\" app called \"Welcome to Ubuntu.\" It points out some of the most-used new features and highlights where things are in the occasionally inscrutable GNOME interface. It's not quite as in-depth and useful as Ubuntu MATE's Welcome app, but it should get you up and running and point out some apps you might want to install (all of which are Snap applications; more on that below). This is also the place to opt out of Ubuntu's data gathering, which grabs some statistics about your system hardware. For the most part, how the transition to GNOME goes for you will boil down to a simple question\u2014did you use the HUD, the keyboard-driven menu selection feature in Unity? If the answer is \"yes,\" you're going to hate GNOME Shell. If the answer is \"no,\" you'll probably be able to switch to GNOME without too much trouble. If you were a HUD user and you don't want to learn a new workflow, I have two options for you. One is to install the version of Unity 7 that's in the Ubuntu repos. It's community supported and seems to be active so far. Option two is to switch to Ubuntu MATE and change the desktop theme to \"Mutiny,\" which has a HUD-based feature. With a little fiddling in the config editor, that can be made to mimic Unity pretty closely. If you weren't a HUD user, your transition to GNOME will likely be much smoother. Ubuntu 18.04 looks roughly the same as 16.04, which helps smooth the transition to GNOME somewhat. After all, Unity was built on top of the same GTK libraries, GNOME components, and GNOME apps as, well, GNOME. That means most of the apps and interfaces you'll be using in GNOME will be very similar to what you used in Unity. There are some exceptions, though. Files, the default GNOME file manager app, is a good example of the sort of subtle but important differences between 16.04 and 18.04. In Unity, Ubuntu used an older version of Files and heavily patched it to add some functionality that had long since been deleted by the GNOME developers. In 18.04, all that work has been tossed out. Files is up to date, and there are no patches. That means there are some new features, like the ability to tag files and a new search interface. Perhaps the biggest change from stock GNOME in Ubuntu 18.04 is the ability to put folders and files on the desktop. GNOME developers consider the desktop concept outdated, and they use the \"desktop\" pretty much as a wallpaper display tool. Ubuntu has done a bit of tweaking so that you can actually put launchers, folders, and files on your desktop, which should be welcome news for many Ubuntu users. How long that will last is an open question, though, since GNOME just completely removed the code that made it possible for Canonical to enable this feature. For now at least, if you want files and folders on your desktop, you're all set. Another potential source of pain for Unity refugees coming into the GNOME fold is the top bar, which behaves a little differently in GNOME. It has app indicators, status messages, network controls, and user sessions like Unity, but this iteration also adds a different app menu and a calendar applet in the center of the screen. There's also something like a global menu, minus the menu. When apps are maximized, the name of the app appears in the top menu, along with a one-item menu\u2014quit is generally your only option. A couple of apps have a few extra items in their menus\u2014Terminal and Files, for example\u2014but it's a far cry from the menu-in-top-bar feature of Unity. Another thing you'll notice in this release is that the window management buttons are back on the right side of the title bar. You can change this with the GNOME Tweak Tool if you'd like them back on the left. Once you get past the differences with Unity, however, there's much to like about this release. GNOME Shell is different from Unity, but it's not necessarily worse. It's certainly a pretty desktop, and Ubuntu's default theme has received quite a few updates that make it look really nice, especially in Files. There were rumors of a brand-new theme, perhaps one that doesn't involve any brown or orange even, but that did not materialize in time for this release. And of course, there are plenty of GNOME themes out there if you'd like to try something else. I reverted to stock for the screenshot here, but I generally prefer the dark variant of the Arc theme. Ubuntu 18.04 ships with GNOME 3.28, which has a number of new features worth mentioning. There's a new Night Light app, which warms your monitor's color temperature after sunset to lessen eye strain. There's also improved support for Thunderbolt 3, and there are media player controls in the message tray, which supports just about all the popular media players, including Rhythmbox and Spotify. This version of GNOME Shell also features a much improved system for dealing with those annoying \"captive portal\" dialogs you get from many public Wi-Fi hotspots these days. For me, browsers have always been hit or miss at dealing with these, but GNOME's tool has yet to miss, and that alone is almost enough to make me use it on a daily basis. (Full disclosure: I am an i3wm user, not because I especially love tiling window managers, but because it's easy on the RAM and because I just don't need my \"desktop\" to do much. If it displays apps on-screen and doesn't crash I'm happy). Listing image by Scott Gilbertson You must login or create an account to comment.

Those of us who think seriously about language design have long been aware that C\u2019s flat-address-space model is increasingly at odds with the real world of memory-caching hierarchies. Chisnall\u2019s main contribution is to notice that speculative execution, the feature at the bottom of the Spectre and Meltdown bugs, is essentially a hack implemented to allow C programmers to maintain the illusion that they\u2019re running on a really fast serial machine.\u00a0 But he has other interesting points as well. I recommend reading Chisnall\u2019s article before you go further with this post. It\u2019s no news to my regulars that I\u2019ve been putting increasing investment into the Go language and now believe it a plausible candidate to replace C and C++ over most of C\/C++\u2019s range \u2013 that is, outside\u00a0 of kernels and hard realtime.\u00a0 So the question that immediately occurred to me upon reading the article was: Is Go necessarily productive of the same kind of kludge that Chisnall is calling out? Because if it is \u2013 but something else isn\u2019t \u2013 that could be a reason not to overcommit to Go.\u00a0 The twin pressures of demand for lower security defects and the increasing complexity costs of speculative execution are bound to toll heavily against Go if it does demand massive speculative execution and there\u2019s any realistic alternative that does not. Do we need something much more divergent from C (Erlang? Ocaml? Even perhaps Haskell?) for systems programming to follow where the hardware is going? So let\u2019s walk through Chisnall\u2019s discussion points, bounce Go off each one, and see what we can see.\u00a0 What we\u2019ll find implies, I think, some more general conclusions about what will and won\u2019t work in matching language design to real-world workloads and processor architectures.  On C requiring high \u201cinstruction-level parallelism\u201d: So will Go if you write it like C.\u00a0 Sometimes this is not avoidable. To write Go in a way that will keep a modern Intel processor\u2019s instruction pipeline full you need, by Chisnall\u2019s argument, to fruitfully decompose each serial algorithm into somewhere around 180 worker threads.\u00a0 Otherwise you need to do speculative execution to avoid having a significant chunk of your transistor budget simply behaving like a space heater. Go, in itself, doesn\u2019t solve this problem.\u00a0 Sure, it lowers the barriers \u2013 its implementation of CSP via channels and goroutines is quite elegant and a handier toolkit for writing massively concurrent code than I\u2019ve ever seen before.\u00a0 But it\u2019s only a toolkit; a naive translation of serial C code to Go is not going to use it and not going to solve your processor-utilization issue. On the other hand, every other potential competitor to Go has the same problem.\u00a0 It might be the case that (say) Erlang or Rust or Haskell imply a better toolkit for massively concurrent programming, if one but knew how to use it.\u00a0 The problem is that the difficulty of moving any given chunk of production C code, or of writing a functional equivalent for it, rises in direct proportion to the ontological gap you have to jump to get from C to your new language. The real cost of obsolescing speculative execution isn\u2019t moving away from C, it\u2019s what you have to do in your replacement language to go from a naive serial translation of your code to one that seriously jacks up the percentage of your processor clocks doing productive work by using concurrency in some appropriate way.\u00a0 And the real issue is that sometimes this isn\u2019t possible at all. This isn\u2019t just a theoretical issue for me.\u00a0 I\u2019m now scoping the job of moving reposurgeon from Python to Go in order to improve performance on large repositories and and it runs head-on into that wall.\u00a0 Python\u2019s Global Interpreter Lock makes it C-equivalent for this discussion \u2013 yes it has a richer type ontology than C, and GC, but this turns out to help remarkably little with thread decomposition.\u00a0 It makes the trivial resource management issues a bit easier, but that just means you hit the question of how to write an algorithm that really exploits concurrency sooner. Some of reposurgeon\u2019s core operations can\u2019t be factored into things done by a flock of threads at all, because for each commit you might want to vectorize over they do lookups unpredictably far back in time in the repository metadata. Some other operations could be because there are no time-order dependencies, but it\u2019s going to require map-reduce-like partitioning of the metadata, with a high potential for bugs at the joins.\u00a0 Bad news: I think\u00a0 this is going to turn out to be a typical transition problem, not an unusually difficult one. The implication is that the C-like requirement to look like a superfast serial machine (a) is not going away even partially without a lot of very hard work changing our algorithms, and (b) never going to go away entirely because there is an awkward residuum: some serial algorithms don\u2019t have an equivalent that exploits concurrency.\u00a0 I dub these SICK algorithms, for \u201cSerial Intrinsically; Cope, Kiddo!\u201d SICK algorithms include but are not limited to:\u00a0Dijkstra\u2019s n-least-paths algorithm; cycle detection in directed graphs (with implications for 3-SAT solvers); depth first search; computing the nth term in a crypto hash chain; network-flow optimization\u2026and lots of other problems in which you either have to compute sub-results in a strict time order or you have wickedly bad lookup locality in the working set (which can make the working set un-partitionable). There\u2019s actually another Go-specific implementation issue here, too.\u00a0 Theoretically Go could provide a programming model that exposes hardware-level threading in a tractable way.\u00a0 Whether it actually does so \u2013 how much heavier the runtime cost of actual Go threads is \u2013\u00a0 is not clear to me.\u00a0 It depends on details of the Go runtime design that I don\u2019t know. This generalizes. To jack up processor utilization to a degree that makes speculative execution unnecessary, we actually need two preconditions.\u00a0 (1) We need a highly concurrent algorithm (not just 1 or 2 threads but in the neighborhood of 180), and (2) we need the target language\u2019s threading overhead to be sufficiently low on the target architecture that it doesn\u2019t swamp the gains. While Go doesn\u2019t solve the problem of SICK algorithms, it doesn\u2019t worsen the problem either.\u00a0 \u00a0The most we can say is that relative to its competitors it somewhat reduces the friction cost of implementing an algorithmically-concurrent translation of code\u00a0 if there is one to be found. Chisnall also argues that\u00a0 C hides the cache memory hierarchy, making elaborate and sometimes unsuccessful hackery required to avoid triggering expensive cache misses.\u00a0 This is obviously correct once pointed out and I kind of kick myself for not noticing the contextual significance of cache-line optimization sooner. Missing from Chisnall\u2019s argument is any notion of how to do better here. Are we supposed to annotate our programs with cache-priority properties attached to each\u00a0 storage allocation?\u00a0 It\u2019s easy to see how that could have perverse results. Seems like the only realistic alternative would be for the language to have a runtime that behaves like a virtual memory manager, doing its best to avoid cache misses at each level by aging out allocation blocks to the next lower level on an LRU or some similar scheme. Again, Go doesn\u2019t solve this problem, but no more do any of its let\u2019s-replace-C competitors. You couldn\u2019t even really tackle it without making every pointer in the language a double indirect through trampoline storage.\u00a0 (IIRC there was a language on the pre-Unix Mac that actually did this, long ago.) We do get a little help here from the absence of pointer arithmetic in Go. And a little more from the way slices work; they are effectively trampoline storage pointing at elements that could be transparently relocated by a GC \u2013 or a VM embedded in the language runtime. Combining those, though?\u00a0 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been done yet, in Go or anywhere else \u2013 and excuse me, but I don\u2019t want to be the poor bastard who has to debug a language runtime implementing that hot mess. Next, Chisnall has some rather penetrating things to say about how the C language model impedes optimization.\u00a0 Here for he first time we get some serious help from Go that is already implemented \u2013 doesn\u2019t depend on a hypothetical property of the runtime.\u00a0 The fact that for loops in Go naturally use a dedicated iterator construct rather than pointers is going to help a lot with loop-independence proofs in the typical slice or array case.\u00a0 (Rust makes the same call for the same benefit.) Unlike C, Go does not guarantee properties that imply structure field order is fixed to source order.\u00a0 The existing Go implementations don\u2019t reorder to optimize, but they could. There are no exposed pointer offsets, so a compiler is allowed to insert padding to speed up stride access. In general, the C features that Chisnall notes would impede vectorization and SROA have been carefully omitted from Go. Chisnall then describes the problems with loop unswitching in C. I don\u2019t see Go giving any additional optimization leverage here, unless you count the effects of uninitialized variables always being zeroed.\u00a0 That (as Chisnall points out) also guarantees that you can\u2019t have program behavior that is randomly variable depending on the prior contents of memory. Go sweeps away most of the issues under \u201cunderstanding C\u201d.\u00a0 Padding is never visible, bare pointers and pointer offsets are absent, pointers are strongly typed and cannot be interconverted with integer\u00a0 (well, trivially they can but the specification does not guarantee they will round-trip). Integer overflow is the exception. To reduce the runtime overhead of arithmetic Go opts not to overflow-check each operation, the same choice as C\u2019s.\u00a0 That choice could start a whole other argument about speed-vs-safety tradeoffs, but it\u2019s an argument that would wander some distance from Chisnall\u2019s principal concerns and mine, so I\u2019m not going to pursue it. Instead I want to return to the initial question about Go, and then consider in more detail what the existence of SICK algorithms means for processor design. So, is Go a \u201clow-level language\u201d for modern processors?\u00a0 I think the answer is really \u201cNo, because there are very good reasons we\u2019ll never have a \u2018low-level\u2019 language again.\u201d\u00a0 While the ability to manage lots of concurrency fairly elegantly does pull Go in the direction of what goes on on a modern multi-core processor, CSP is a quite abstract and simplified interface to the reality of buzzing threads and lots of test-and-set instructions that has to be going on underneath.\u00a0 Naked, that reality is unmanageable by mere human brains \u2013 at least that\u2019s what the defect statistics from the conventional mutex-and-mailbox approach to doing so\u00a0 say to me. Chisnall begins the last section of his argument by suggesting \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s time to stop trying to make C code fast and instead think about what programming models would look like on a processor designed to be fast.\u201d\u00a0 Here, where he passes from criticism to prescription, is where I think his argument gets in serious trouble.\u00a0 It trips over the fact that there are lots of important SICK algorithms. His prescription for processor design is \u201cLet\u2019s make flocks of threads much faster\u201d.\u00a0 Well, OK \u2013 but I think if you interpret that as a bargain you can make to eliminate speculative execution (which is what Chisnall wants to do, though he never quite says it) there\u2019s a serious risk that you could wind up with an architecture badly matched to a of lot of actual job loads. In fact, I think there is a strong case that this has already happened with the processors we have now.\u00a0 My hexacore Great Beast already has more concurrency capacity than reposurgeon\u2019s graph-surgery language can use effectively (see \u2018wickedly bad lookup locality\u2019 above), and because some operations bottleneck on on SICK algorithms it is certain that getting out from under Python\u2019s GIL won\u2019t\u00a0 entirely fix the problem. Underlying my specific problem is a general principle: you can reduce the demand for instruction-level parallelism to zero only if your job load never includes SICK algorithms.\u00a0 A GPU can pretty much guarantee that.\u00a0 A general Turing machine cannot. Chisnall seems to me to be suffering from a bit of a streetlight effect here. He knows concurrency can make some things really fast, so he recommends making the streetlight brighter even though there are lots of SICK problems we can\u2019t drag to where it shines.\u00a0 To be fair, he\u2019s far from alone in this \u2013 I\u2019ve noticed it in a lot of theoretically-oriented CS types. He finishes by knocking down a strawman about parallel programming being hard for humans, when the real question is whether it can be applied to your job load at all. There is, for some real problems, no substitute for plain old serial speed, and therefore we seem to be stuck with speculative execution. There\u2019s nothing for it but to embrace that SICK. Typo:\n(2) we need the target labguage\u2019s There\u2019s actually another Go-specific implementation issue here, too.  Theoretically Go could provide a programming model that exposes hardware-level threading in a tractable way.  Whether it actually does so \u2013 how much heavier the runtime cost of actual Go threads is \u2013  is not clear to me.  It depends on details of the Go runtime design that I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not close \u2013 by orders of magnitude \u2013 to your level as a programmer, but I\u2019m wondering whether the real answer to this is not to make a particular prescription, but for someone to provide a library which allows some very direct control the issues you\u2019re discussing; which processor does which work, how threads will run, order of execution, etc., with the idea that people can experiment with these issues. Then the improved code can be fed back into the main branch of Go (or Rust, or whatever.) Hopefully I\u2019m not too far from the mark here. ;-) Also, your link is bad. (I think the problem is that you used two different kinds of quotes.) It looks like you edited this in WYSIWYG mode, but put in the entries as if you were editing in text mode, so we\u2019re seeing lots of faux HTML tags, instead of getting cites and links. Of course, multithreaded designs come with their own exploitation risks and Hard Problems. I\u2019m skeptical that they are quite the security panacea that Chisnall is implying. Erlang (and others) try to avoid some of the worst problems with multithreading by making stuff immutable. That\u2019s certainly helpful, but the pure functional style comes with an upfront cost for most programmers (where \u201cmost programmers\u201d == \u201cprogrammers not named Joe Armstrong\u201d :-)). Would we all get better at it if we were using an Erlang-style language for everything? Probably. How much better remains to be seen. Sometimes a design that maintains state is so much cleaner than a pure functional design that it\u2019s not even funny. > when the real question is whether it can be applied to your job load at all. Yes. The old joke about a thousand chickens being stronger than one ox comes to mind (good luck hitching them to a wagon). As does the equally old joke about producing a baby in one month by putting nine women on the job. Erlang looks really awesome. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve never found a good tutorial (by which I mean a good tutorial for someone at my quite amateurish level, who has problems understanding how to write a useful program given the way Erlang uses variables.) Armstrong\u2019s book is actually pretty good. James Hague\u2019s 2008 series (and the 2009 followup) on writing retrogames using a pure functional model is still worth reading.  Part 1: http:\/\/prog21.dadgum.com\/23.html There is, for some real problems, no substitute for plain old serial speed, and therefore we seem to be stuck with speculative execution.  Speculation can\u2019t help SICK algorithms either (except to the extent that speculation necessarily includes pipelining, which is helpful). The thing that makes speculation an improvement over pipelining is that it runs two (extremely low overhead) threads per branch decision:  one for if the branch was taken, one for if it was not (possibly applied recursively to multiple branches in processors with really deep pipelines).  If the algorithm isn\u2019t parallelizable at all, then half the speculative execution results will be discarded, and the speculation is just guaranteeing you spend as much as 50% of your computing power in waste heat (though that might still be a reasonable tradeoff if there are order-of-magnitude savings in other parts of the CPU, e.g. less idle time due to more complete memory bus utilization). Modern CPUs can do parallel execution optimizations for you in real time given only legacy x86 machine code to work with.  That sets the floor for what human programmers should be worried about at the human-readable language level.  Even worrying about it at the compiler and toolchain level is a dubious exercise\u2013didn\u2019t Intel already try that with Itanium? C hides the cache memory hierarchy, making elaborate and sometimes unsuccessful hackery required to avoid triggering expensive cache misses.   Those cache misses show up in cache-line profiling, and C makes it easy(er) to apply the advice of the profiler to avoid hot spots compared to other languages which don\u2019t have predictable structure packing behavior.  Rumor has it that some languages with unspecified structure packing have toolchains that can automate structure layout reorganizations based on profiling data (I have yet to see a useful one in real life though).  There\u2019s still a fairly low limit on what can be done without changing the algorithms, and so far only humans can do that in non-trivial cases (and only when a non-SICK algorithm exists). Amdahl\u2019s law has linear scaling of performance in the number of cores as an upper bound for good reasons; one of them is SICK algorithms. I was watching some marketing videos for the Transputer last night. They claimed that the Transputer always scales linearly in the number of CPUs and demonstrated this with\u2013er, ray tracers, Mandelbrot set renderers, and programs that drew Mandelbrot sets into ray-traced scenes. The Transputer was once hailed as the next big thing, arguably the greatest thing to happen to computing since the microprocessor itself. It failed in part because the system architecture falls down hard on SICK algorithms, particularly those with large working sets. Not only would runtime of such an algorithm be constrained by the speed of a single Transputer, but Transputers were inherently NUMA \u2014 each CPU came with a sliver of RAM on board, and system memory was the sum of all the RAM slivers on each CPU die. Accordingly, to work with a large dataset, Transputers had to divide the working set across all CPUs, and then coordinate with one another to either fetch needed data to a CPU that had it, or hand off control to another CPU, feeding it the data it needs. Sure made for some sweet, sweet demos though. How does someone get to the level where they can write an article on this \u2013 that gets noticed no less \u2013 without having had their faces rubbed in Amdahl\u2019s Law already? \u201cThere is, for some real problems, no substitute for plain old serial speed, and therefore we seem to be stuck with speculative execution.\u201d Maybe the solution is not in a new general language for all workloads on \u201cbig\u201d CPUs.. Maybe the solution is in developing processors for specific workloads. This is already done with GPUs and TPUs in machine learning. Move parallelizable loads to massive parallel GPUs etc and use traditioal CPUs for the SICK stuff. >Move parallelizable loads to massive parallel GPUs etc and use traditioal CPUs for the SICK stuff. We\u2019re already doing this.  It\u2019s why graphics cards exist.  Duh. :-) I know. But why then trying to shoehorn massive parallel loads onto a serial CPU? This sounds like you have a hammer, so you treat every problem as a nail. >But why then trying to shoehorn massive parallel loads onto a serial CPU? Jobs like reposurgeon don\u2019t have any other choice.  Many of its algorithms won\u2019t run on a GPU. > I know. But why then trying to shoehorn massive parallel\n> loads onto a serial CPU? Other way around. Running VERY serial workloads on increasingly parallel CPUs.  Several reasons: 0) \u201cWe\u201d are pretty much at the limit of how fast \u2018we\u2019 can make a single core\/cpu run. All the other stuff \u201cwe\u201d are adding is to make cores\/dies\/whatever do more work in the same number of clock cycles.  1) Commodity (mass market desktop\/server) CPUs are marketed, like everything else, on a \u201ccheckbox\u201d basis. This CPU has 4 cores and 8 threads, that CPU has 1 core and 4 threads, therefore THIS ONE is better. Same with all the other crud. That it\u2019s going in a desktop that sits idle for 8 to 20 hours a day, and almost never uses anything near it\u2019s real capacity is irrelevant. Checklists win.  2) Regardless of a specific workload, modern *operating systems* can take advantage of multicore\/multithread CPUs because they have lots of discrete tasks running at the same time. Things like browsing the web, watching porn, having a video game running in the background, having your mail client checking the mail server, IRC window, etc. all running at the same time means you WANT at least 2 cores and 4 threads.  For \u201cSICK\u201d workloads you\u2019d want almost the opposite of a GPU\u2013something to stick in the backplane of a commodity server\/desktop box with a insanely fast single core processor and gobs of local memory.  But you\u2019d have maybe 200 sales inquiries a year, but because each CPU would have a MASSIVE cost (minimal amortization)  and so your only sales would be to TLAs who have very specific needs. Except it wouldn\u2019t, because modern multi-core chips will always be a little slower, but MUCH cheaper. The message-passing ways to \u201cavoid synchronization problems\u201d have been around for a long time but they have two problems: First, outside of the problems with the \u201cnatural pipelining\u201d they\u2019re a pain to program, and sometimes it\u2019s really hard to make sure that these programs work right (Veritas High Availability Cluster of yore comes to mind as an extremely buggy example). Second, once the problem is not obvious, such as if you need to lock _two_ locks at once, doing is with message passing is very difficult and still has all the pitfalls of the usual locking (you can find an example of this in the section \u201cQueues as the sole synchronization mechanism\u201d of my book \u201cThe practice of parallel programming\u201d, the free text available at http:\/\/web.newsguy.com\/sab123\/tpopp\/06odata.txt ). I think the first problem can be at least partially solved with the better compiler support: to avoid the manual management of the context for the messages, it would be nicer to just write the code the old-fashioned way and then have the function\u2019s stack frame placed in the dynamic memory, so that the execution can be picked up and continued on it when the reply message comes back. The Promises might be a step towards this, and Microsoft had also been experimenting along these lines in C#. The goroutines also have another problem, with the channels they use for communications (unless I\u2019m out of date on this). Basically, the channels in Go are either with delivery guarantee and flow control, or without flow control and lossy. Once you start doing cyclical topologies, you\u2019re stuck with either a possibility of deadlock if you use all reliable channels, or the possibility of a loss if you use an unreliable channel. A better solution would be to use the \u201creverse\u201d channels with unlimited buffering and a higher priority, so that if a thread has a choice of what channel to read, it would always read the \u201creverse\u201d channel first. With this approach, it\u2019s also fairly easy to detect the defective topologies when they get constructed, as I\u2019ve done in the Triceps CEP project. As for speculative execution, perhaps it\u2019s not to be shunned but to be embraced: basically, you trade some otherwise unused computational power for a chance to make a faster progress and return it to the main task. I wonder if the cycle detection in the graphs can make use of it: do the growth in multiple directions in parallel, then after a few steps stop and reconcile this progress, do the next wave, and so on. If the reconcilement is cheaper than the expansion, this would result in a faster overall progress. Of course, some of the results of the expansion will be duplicates and will be thrown away but that\u2019s to be expected with the speculative execution. So the real problem is how to make the reconcilement cheap. The problem is that Moore\u2019s law took a detour.  Originally processing speed was linear, but the worse legacy is the Intel \u201ccompatibility back to the original 4004\u201d that the x86 abomination represents.  If we can get those to go 4GHz, we probably could have gotten a PPC or some other single core RISC processor to go 20GHz.  Arm has been handicapped by its focus on low power but is close to the simplicity, as was the 68k series.  The x86 instruction set is like Chinese pictogram characters v.s. a phonetic alphabet.  Remember the huge real estate used by the extra complex cores could be turned into a minimal cycle ram cache or even some kind of local memory. So this argument is because the less expensive hardware processors are not optimal except with many threads \u2013 think of requiring a V12 with multiple valves and a 10 speed transmission \u2013 we have to adapt the software and languages to using it instead of something like a 2 rotor Wankel that runs at 20k RPM. I\u2019m actually shocked that there is no embedded core processor I can think of that goes above 2GHz, and even ARM, which should be easy to the point of trivial to do barely exists \u2013 Most top out around 1.8Ghz with 4 cores. >I\u2019m actually shocked that there is no embedded core processor I can think of that goes above 2GHz, and even ARM, which should be easy to the point of trivial to do barely exists \u2013 Most top out around 1.8Ghz with 4 cores. Well, instead of being shocked you should consider this a clue about the economics driving processor design. Your report says there\u2019s lots of market for low power consumption and not so much for really high-speed serial CPUs. >  Arm has been handicapped by its focus on low power but is close to\n> the simplicity, as was the 68k series. It\u2019s not handicapped by it, it still exists BECAUSE of it. Otherwise the Intel world would have eaten it up too.  MIPS is still hanging on in many of same markets. Well, it\u2019s probably on life support. Anyone who thinks ARM is simple should spend some time looking over the Cortex-M7 user manual. x86 isn\u2019t executed natively anymore by most processors. It\u2019s translated to a risc-like instruction set internally to the processor. That is a lot of die space wasted on the silicon that translates x86 instructions, but that isn\u2019t what\u2019s holding down our clock speeds. IBM continued pushing Power chips forward to higher clock speeds but still only managed about the same speeds we\u2019re getting with modern x86-64 chips. The best they\u2019ve done was Power6, which managed about 5ghz on a Dual core. This is right about where Intel Coffee Lake 4\/6-core processors are now. Their recent Power9 chips have gone down to 4ghz, mostly because they\u2019re pushing for far more cores now (12-24.)   Snapdragon 800 series arm processors have definitely gone up to at least 2.3ghz in released products. The thing is, Chisnall talks about Spectre and Meltdown being a result of using speculative execution to preserve the \u201cfast PDP-11\u201d model, but for PDP-11s that had MMUs, modern machines have a flatter address space than the PDP-11, and using the PDP-11 model would eliminate Meltdown without a performance penalty: The PDP-11 had separate user and kernel address spaces, so userspace could not even attempt to read from kernel space. >The PDP-11 had separate user and kernel address spaces, so userspace could not even attempt to read from kernel space. Well, of course he\u2019s thinking of the later revs with the 22-bit extension. I don\u2019t believe that any PDP-11 with any MMU, 18-bit or 22-bit, lacked separate kernel and user spaces. What wasn\u2019t present till late in the game was separate instruction and data spaces. The pre-MMU 11s with 16-bits of physical address space addressed directly were, IIRC, the only ones that had no distinction between kernel and user space. >Chisnall talks about Spectre and Meltdown being a result of using speculative execution to preserve the \u201cfast PDP-11\u201d model I withdraw my earlier comment after having seen a picture of the guy.  He\u2019s too young to remember either machine directly (no blame; the PDP-11 was just before my time). I now think what he really means is \u201cthe VAX model\u201d, and isn\u2019t aware of the PDP-11 MMU at all. For full disclosure, I\u2019m also too young to remember it directly, but I\u2019m keenly interested in memory management schemes and have a bit of a retrocomputing obsession, so I\u2019m probably in the 90th percentile among geeks my age (that even know what a PDP-11 is) for knowledge of PDP-11 memory management. No matter what you pick, you are going to end up with something for systems programming that involves raw pointers. For many classes of device-driver programming, etc., you need to be able to reliably bit-bang, including specifying memory barriers, etc. C allows you to do this with some degree of ease, as long as you\u2019re willing to wrap a tiny bit of assembly into a macro. I\u2019m not sure how the other languages support this. At one of my previous job where tasks were executed in parallel and processing time was measured in microseconds, one of my co-workers was give a job to implement a complex state machine with a budget of 2 cache lines. This was turned into (one of) the unions from hell. But by fitting everything into 2 cache lines it was possible to avoid cache stalls and get much higher throughput. >No matter what you pick, you are going to end up with something for systems programming that involves raw pointers.  C will not soon be dislodged from the use cases you\u2019re talking about, but I think they\u2019re a shrinking niche.  Much as assembler was in my beginning years as a programmer, and for the same reasons. Here\u2019s a cynical answer \u2026 just figure out what Intel uses as the bottom layer of microcode and then we\u2019ll all write our programs in whatever that is. Does anyone know how many layers of translation an x86 instruction goes thru before it is ever actually executed by whatever sort of processor actually underlies Intel\u2019s \u201cx86\u201d chips. Oh, and it\u2019s reported they have MINIX running in there somewhere \u2013 entirely invisible to the user of their \u201cx86\u201d chip. My prediction: Meltdown and Spectre are just the first droplets of a coming tsunami that will provide a painful lesson that complexity is the biggest enemy of security. Thus spake the cynic. >Thus spake the cynic. I would not place a large bet on you being wrong. > Oh, and it\u2019s reported they have MINIX running in there somewhere \u2013 entirely invisible to the user of their \u201cx86\u201d chip. The version of the rumor I remember is that the \u201cmagic manager\u201d part of the chip ran a modified version of MINUX at some point.  (You remember, the thing that combined with a specific chipset and network interface chip gave an untraceable\/unblockable back door into your system?) Intel Management Engine\u2026 *shudders* Now that\u2019s a security nightmare. It\u2019s enough to make one use AMD chips instead of Intel. (I wonder what hidden security bugs are lurking in AMD\u2019s CPUs\u2026) AMD chips have similar management code, but it\u2019s less likely to be activated by default. It runs on a separate ARM core as well, IIRC. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/AMD_Platform_Security_Processor Yeah, the MINIX thing is part of the AMT thing that Intel does in their chipsets, not (AFAIK) in the CPU itself. Not that that diminishes Michael\u2019s point or makes AMT any less awful. The impression I get is that the MINIX instance is part of AMT, but is stored in the CPU firmware. However, my understanding is that it\u2019s perfectly normal x86 code running in a special processor mode, not implemented in the language of the chip\u2019s own microcode. Now that I look into it more, different sources are saying different things. There was a flurry of articles after the ME\/AMT vulnerability last year. Probably nobody outside Intel really knows. The most interesting one I found was about Dell selling special custom computers with ME disabled. The most interesting one I found was about Dell selling special custom computers with ME disabled. They are very expensive, and only available to TLAs or other organizations with very special security concerns. As will be any computer without active surveillance built in in the future. My information has it that the Intel ME (and MINIX OS) runs on a special, Pentium-class SoC that resides within the motherboard chipset. It\u2019s not onboard the main CPU, but in most configurations the main CPU will not run unless it detects working ME. (Again, the CIA, NSA, etc. get special dispensation on this front \u2014 but it\u2019s pricey.) Note that this means the ME processor is not vulnerable to Meltdown or Spectre, being based on a non-speculating processor. At the very least, until we get access to that layer, no programming language implementers can get a good sense of what the hardware can actually do, and start building languages that can leverage it. We\u2019re stuck with languages that look like C because the lowest layer we can drop to looks like C. Sidenote: while depth-first search is hard or maybe even impossible to run in parallel, breadth-first search can and is done in parallel, even parallel on GPU (though fast parallelization on GPU needs some tricks and\/or extra support from hardware for fast atomics). I think that drawing any kind of wider conclusion about speculative execution from the existence of Spectre and Meltdown is a mistake.  The problem of preventing a killed speculation from affecting state is already a solved one \u2014 processors do it just fine for architecturally-visible state.  Spectre-v1 and Meltdown just demonstrated that architecturally-invisible state can be inferred by user code and that therefore for security reasons it has to be protected in the same way.  That is, treat cacheline fills like register writes, forwarding them along the pipeline and only committing them when (and if) the branch\/speculation retires.  That shouldn\u2019t have much performance cost, since memory reads in incorrectly speculated branches are likely to be through bad or unwanted pointers that you don\u2019t want polluting your cache anyway. The same applies even more strongly to Spectre-v2, where indirect branches performed in one address space can train the branch predictor to affect predictions in another address space.  Even when nothing malicious is going on, this is polluting the prediction statistics with irrelevant data, reducing the accuracy of predictions.  Tagging BTB entries with the address space isn\u2019t just a security thing, it\u2019s the Right Thing. The conclusion that can be drawn from Spectre and Meltdown is that \u201carchitecturally invisible\u201d processor optimisations aren\u2019t invisible, and thus in the same way that certain kinds of secure code (e.g. crypto) have to take care to avoid side-channel creation by compiler optimisations, they will also have to take care to avoid side-channel creation by processor optimisations.  In order to do this, it will be necessary for chip makers to start documenting their architecturally invisible behaviour (I\u2019m sure that will give them a fit \u2014 having to tell the world all about their secret sauce!) so that these kinds of vulnerabilities can be prevented in the future. But as I say, this has nothing to do with speculation, and there is no reason to think that speculative\/OoO execution is obsolete or a busted flush. Naive questions here, but what would happen if you took speculation all the way out? Would it eliminate the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilites? What performance tradeoff would we be looking at? I assume slower performance but less energy. This could be a selling point, say, for any properly security-conscious need. Also, eco-friendly if you want to go green. Would it just be apps that would need to be rewritten? The OS itself? Something in between them? All of the above? >Naive questions here, but what would happen if you took speculation all the way out?  We don\u2019t have to speculate.  Spectre and Meltdown fixes have been applied in the Linux kernel.  This article reports a minimal hit on one network-heavy workload, but we shoulds expect it to be worse when throughput is not bottlnecked on network stalls. This article says < 5% for current Intel chips, but admits to a up to a 31% latency hit on older ones like i7s.\n\n>I assume slower performance but less energy.

Nothing needs to be rewritten.  Speculative execution is a processor-level optimization that is invisible to code above it except through side channel monitoring (that\u2019s the leak these exploits use).

There is something remarkable about the lava spurting out of Kilauea, the miles-wide shield volcano on Hawaii\u2019s Big Island that fissured anew last week. It cuts across roads, forming berms of black and smoldering rock. It bursts from the ground, dancing like bubbles above a cauldron. In one video, it creeps across the land and then devours a Ford Mustang. So far, the lava has destroyed 35 structures in total, including 25 homes. This current activity may continue for some time: On Tuesday, two new lava fissures opened. One of the new cracks sits uphill of Lanipuna Gardens, a subdivision of 250 people that was evacuated last week but has so far remained unharmed. Hawaii Civil Defense ordered the mandatory evacuation of its last remaining residents Tuesday evening. Yet numbers don\u2019t get at the potency of the lava, at its otherworldliness. Where other volcanoes sometimes appear powdery or drab, Kilauea\u2019s lava glows red. Other lava hardens soon after it bursts from the ground; Kilauea\u2019s lava remains hot enough to ooze forward, setting cars on fire. In just this episode alone, Kilauea\u2019s energy has torn a new, 2.5-mile-long hole in the ground. Both geoscientists and native Hawaiians agree that Hawaii\u2019s lava is special. But they have different ways of talking about why that is\u2014and different ways of seeing the substance that defines their profession or gives them a home. For scientists, the defining quality of Hawaii\u2019s lava is its chemistry. It\u2019s what geologists call a basaltic lava, and this affects everything from its color to its hazards. There are roughly two types of lava\u2014and both types are, of course, runny and hot. Kilauea\u2019s lava is formed by the melting of an oceanic plate, which means that it contains less silicon dioxide\u2014the same mineral that becomes quartz\u2014than continental plates. As such, it\u2019s extremely runny and super hot. It also doesn\u2019t put up much resistance to gases, which can freely pass through it. (When a continental plate melts, you get an eruption more like Mount St. Helens: That lava is stickier, and it often traps gas until it suddenly all escapes at once.) Mika McKinnon, a geophysicist and disaster researcher, said this gives Hawaii\u2019s lava a special characteristic: It\u2019s \u201cexactly like you imagine hot lava as a kid, leaping between furniture,\u201d she told me in an email. \u201cThe geochemistry of Hawaiian lavas means [that it forms] smooth, laminar flow in snaking rivers. It\u2019s also extremely hot, giving it that iconic fiery glow.\u201d That fiery glow, that childlike quality\u2014it makes sense that some journalists have fallen back on cinema to describe the eruption. Watching videos of Kilauea\u2019s lava, I kept thinking of the first time I ever saw lava on screen: the Cave of Wonders sequence in Disney\u2019s Aladdin. Another science journalist\u2014upon seeing the lava lake at the summit of Kilauea, which has brimmed with molten fire this month\u2014recalled the cracks of Mount Doom in The Lord of the Rings.  \u201cPart of why these eruptions look familiar is that it\u2019s easier to safely photograph and record them than faster-moving, more violent eruptions, so these images are the ones we more commonly see in kids\u2019 science books, or inspiring artists when they\u2019re animating movies,\u201d McKinnon told me in an email. \u201cKilauea\u2019s lava is 1,170 degrees Celsius (or 2,140 degrees Fahrenheit) when it erupts, with the surface starting to cool within a few hundred seconds,\u201d she said. \u201cAs it cools, it creates a crust that the lava flow breaks through over and over again.\u201d You can often estimate the temperature of lava by its color, she added. Yellow lava is the hottest, burning somewhere between 1,000 and 1,200 degrees Celsius (about 1,830 to 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit). Orange lava smolders between 800 and 1,000 degrees Celsius (about 1,500 to 1,830 degrees Fahrenheit). And red lava is actually the coolest, at 600 to 800 degrees Fahrenheit (about 1,100 to 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit). But photographs taken at night are often color-corrected, throwing off this scale, McKinnon warned. In addition to the many colors of lava, there are several types of lava that can appear during one eruption. \u201cIn Hawaiian-style eruptions, you get pahoehoe, the ropey lava that looks like a sticky river when flowing; and a\u2019a, with is the rubbly lava that looks like a tractor-tread of debris moving and tumbling,\u201d said Eric Klemetti, a professor of volcanology at Dennison University, in an email. \u201cThose differ based on things like temperature and crystal contact, as a\u2019a is a stickier lava.\u201d Scientists turn to precise instruments for their information. Jascha Polet, a geophysicist at California State Polytechnic at Ponoma, said researchers look to two sets of data\u2014from instruments on the volcano itself and from images from satellites in orbit\u2014to learn about Kilauea\u2019s \u201cplumbing system,\u201d its subsurface network of lava tubes and flows. Scientists use this data to improve their volcanism forecasts, as they try to understand \u201cwhat types of deformation and seismic signals occur as precursory activity before an eruption,\u201d Polet told me in an email. But Western scientists were not the first people to encounter Hawaii\u2019s volcanoes. Native Hawaiians have lived on the islands, and among the volcanoes, for more than 900 years. And their history, literature, and culture all recognize the reality of living near such a powerful phenomenon. (A brief language note: Everyone who lives in the archipelago is called a \u201cHawaii resident.\u201d The term \u201cHawaiian\u201d is reserved for someone with native Hawaiian ancestry. This distinction is regularly made on the islands, including in the state constitution.) \u201cThere\u2019s a\u2019a or pahoehoe, the rough lava or the smooth lava,\u201d said Ku\u2019ualoha Ho\u2019omanawanui, a professor of literature at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. \u201cBut the word for both of them is Pele.\u201d Pele is the Hawaiian deity of volcanoes, lava, and fire\u2014but deity in its Western sense doesn\u2019t quite describe the scope of Pele\u2019s power. Many Hawaiian families trace their lineage back to Pele, meaning they count her as an ancestor. \u201cPele is not just the goddess of lava. Lava is Pele,\u201d Ho\u2019omanawanui told me. \u201cThe lava flows basically reaffirm what our literature tells us\u2014that the land is alive, that Pele is alive. When we talk about the lava being alive, it\u2019s a metaphor for the earth itself being alive. The lava is Pele, the magma is Pele, the lava flow and then when the lava hardens\u2014each you can just replace the word with Pele.\u201d Even the site of the new eruption makes sense within Hawaiian culture. The current eruption has focused primarily on a subdivision called Leilani Estates. But Leilani Estates is a new name, and the subdivision sits within a larger area that Hawaiians traditionally called Keahialaka, which means \u201cthe fire of Laka.\u201d Laka is the goddess of hula and one of Pele\u2019s daughters. \u201cThe Hawaiians watching are looking at the names of these places and saying, \u2018Oh yeah!\u2019\u201d said Noelani M. Arista, a professor of Hawaiian history at the University of Hawaii. \u201cIt\u2019s like, sometimes people are amazed that a flood will hit a flood zone. But we\u2019ve got place names that say flood zone.\u201d \u201cAnyone can come and slap a new name on any thing: \u2018Let\u2019s call it Leilani Estates!\u2019 And Leilani is a generic name. But that won\u2019t take away from the mana, the spiritual power and characteristics of that place, that the old place name embodies,\u201d agreed Ho\u2019omanawanui. These new names \u201clull people into a sense of complacency,\u201d she said. \u201c[They think,] I\u2019m not actually buying property and building a house in an active lava rift zone, but I\u2019m buying a piece of paradise.\u201d But sometimes these new names can be ironic. Kilauea is surrounded by rainforest, and people in Hawaii customarily link its lava flows to the Kool-Aid-red lehua flowers that grow around it. So when Ho\u2019omanawanui read that one of the first lava fissures in Leilani Estates opened up on Mohala Street, she laughed. \u201cWell, of course!\u201d she said. \u201cMohala means \u2018to blossom,\u2019 or \u2018to bloom.\u2019 In a way, it\u2019s all interconnected.\u201d Pele\u2019s story takes many forms\u2014Ho\u2019omanawanui has studied 14 different serialized newspaper versions of it, all of which first appeared in the 19th century. But many describe a similar journey: how Pele and her family came up from an island in the South Pacific, how they found the Hawaii archipelago, and how Pele traveled to every island, looking for a place to keep her fire. She visited every island, and dug a hole in every island, until she eventually found Hawaii Island and placed her fire in Kilauea. (Ho\u2019omanawanui recommended that mainland Americans watch Holo Mai Pele, a PBS-filmed hula about Pele, for a credible summary of her story.) \u201cThe story of Pele is a poetic, literary telling of what scientists would maybe call the Ring of Fire, and how volcanic activity gets to the Hawaiian islands from other parts of the Pacific,\u201d said Ho\u2019omanawanui. \u201cIt\u2019s an ideological explanation for why we don\u2019t have volcanic activity occurring now on the other islands.\u201d But it\u2019s more than a just-so story. Arista, the Hawaiian historian, contrasts how non-native Hawaii residents and native Hawaiians have discussed the recent lava flow. Much of the national media attention has focused on an American-centric understanding of the destruction, she said\u2014for instance, by talking about the extent of property loss. \u201cBut then you\u2019ve got Hawaiians saying, how amazing is the presence of this in my life,\u201d she said. \u201cNative people who live in the subdivision are largely saying, \u2018Yes, I knew I was living in this space where volcanic activity is a huge factor, because I\u2019ve lived my life here. And because we have this respect for Pele, I wanted to live here.\u2019\u201d Ho\u2019omanawanui said she saw many native Hawaiians greeting the lava flow not with dread, but with acceptance. \u201cWhen the flows start, you clean the house, you open the door, and you say: \u2018T\u016bt\u016b Pele, this is your land, take it,\u2019\u201d she said. (Since Ho\u2019omanawanui\u2019s family tracks its lineage back to Pele, they call her T\u016bt\u016b, or grandmother. But other Hawaiians and non-Natives will call her T\u016bt\u016b Pele out of respect, even if she is not an ancestor to them. \u201cThey acknowledge she\u2019s a special force of nature\u2014literally,\u201d she said. Others, including non-Natives, may call her Madame Pele for the same reason.) Ho\u2019omanawanui and Arista told me that seeing the lava as Pele didn\u2019t detract from the scientific understanding of it. Instead, Pele anchors the experience of the lava, envelops it, and connects it to the lives of people who came before. \u201cThrough dance, through costuming, through specific flowers\u2014there\u2019s layers of representation that I think really evoke a sensory experience beyond just knowledge, beyond just understanding as a Western scientific geological process,\u201d said Ho\u2019omanawanui. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete experience that is inclusive of that [scientific] knowledge but goes way beyond it.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t have the words for belief or faith in this stuff,\u201d she said. Instead, she said, Westerners should see Hawaiian customary belief as a practice and as a way of understanding the world. Lately, Hawaiian women who practice hula\u2014including hula about Pele\u2019s story\u2014discuss how thrilling it is to see this real-life, contemporary connection to their art. \u201c[Hula] is a weekly practice,\u201d said Arista, \u201cand that weekly practice stretches for years. So it\u2019s a dance [these women have] come to inhabit and know\u2014and when they watch the volcano erupting now, they can see the movement. They can see what the movement is talking about.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a whole class of words that belong to the description of [Pele and her] family, that have to do with fire, anger, heat, and light, and you won\u2019t know them unless you speak and read Hawaiian, and chant, and dance,\u201d she said. Sometimes the customary understanding can anticipate the scientific view. When Pele makes her journey from the south, she is accompanied by an entourage of family members. These represent all the activity that accompanies an eruption: So one brother may be lightning, several sisters may be the trees and flowers of the rainforest, and several other brothers are sharks. Scientists now know that lightning can accompany a volcanic eruption. (Researchers successfully recorded volcanic thunder for the first time earlier this year.) But recent research has suggested sharks may sense volcanic lightning and electromagnetic energy with their electroreceptors. This may let them find new volcanoes\u2014and new sources of life, and food\u2014across the ocean. \u201cWhen you experience a volcanic eruption at the crater in the mountain, there\u2019s a whole lot of other activity that accompanies it. There are storms that gather, there\u2019s electrical energy in the air. I\u2019ve seen waterspouts form offshore,\u201d said Ho\u2019omanawanui. \u201cFrom a Western perspective, they all get separated out\u2014they say, look at that lava eruption\u2014and they don\u2019t see all the other stuff that\u2019s happening.\u201d She added that many geoscientists, who spend days camped on the volcano and apart from civilization, come to see the volcano in this light. \u201cThey are often very steeped in their environment\u2014it\u2019s impressive to me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really a worldview-changing experience\u2014in how you see the world, the Earth and the universe\u2014to know that you\u2019re really seeing new land being birthed right before your eyes.\u201d And that\u2019s why many Hawaiians see the latest eruption as a kind of warning, both women told me. As the islands have filled with non-Hawaiian residents, and as these newcomers have run afoul of longstanding custom and of environmental laws, they are misunderstanding and misusing the land. There\u2019s a story about Pele and a place called Kapa\u2019ahu, which is not so far from Leilani Estates on the Big Island. It tells of how Pele once wrapped herself in a cloak of a\u2019a lava in order to take a nap\u2014the kapa in Kapa\u2019ahu means cloak\u2014and warned her family not to wake her up. Hours later, she was awakened by an incessant, annoying drumbeat. She stalked off to look for it\u2014and she eventually found it, and an alluring male hula leader, on the other side of the archipelago: at Ke\u2019e Beach on Kauai Island. Kapa\u2019ahu now sits under black, hardened lava, paved over by Kilauea\u2019s eruption a decade ago. And the northern entire section of Kauai was devastated by floods a month ago, part of a rain system that damaged or destroyed more than 500 homes across the state. Many parts of Kauai, including Ke\u2019e Beach, remain largely inaccessible to daily traffic. \u201cA lot of Hawaiians in my community have been saying that they don\u2019t really see it as a coincidence that, on one end of the archipelago, you have this horrific flooding\u2014and now on the complete opposite end, you have lava flows destroying as well,\u201d said Ho\u2019omanawanui. It seems like Hawaii is declaring its fragility and its power all at once, she said. Arista, the historian, agreed. \u201cWhen you look at social media, at the kinds of conversations that Hawaii residents are having, they say: We\u2019ve got floods on one end [of the archipelago], and we\u2019ve got fire on the other. And a lot of local Hawaiians go, yep, that\u2019s what it means to live in these islands.\u201d \u201cThat fire is not a new phenomenon,\u201d she told me. \u201cThe flood, on the other hand, might be climate change.\u201d \n    An American Muslim travels to the West Bank to meet Israelis living in the occupied territory and the Palestinians who oppose them.\n Every year, more than 400,000 crabs are bled for the miraculous medical substance that flows through their bodies\u2014now pharmaceutical companies are finally committing to an alternative that doesn't harm animals. Horseshoe crabs are sometimes called \u201cliving fossils\u201d because they have been around in some form for more than 450 million years. In this time, the Earth has gone through multiple major ice ages, a Great Dying, the formation and subsequent breaking up of Pangaea, and an asteroid impact that killed the dinosaurs and most of life on Earth yet again. In other words, horseshoe crabs have truly seen some shit. Yet, I would conjecture, some of their strangest experiences must have come in just the past few decades, as one of the soft-bodied mammals that came after dinosaurs began using their hands to scoop horseshoe crabs out of the ocean en masse. Contemporary humans do not deliberately kill the horseshoe crabs\u2014as did previous centuries of farmers catching them for fertilizer or fishermen using them as bait. Instead, they scrub the crabs clean of barnacles, fold their hinged carapaces, and stick stainless steel needles into a soft, weak spot, in order to draw blood. Horseshoe crab blood runs blue and opaque, like antifreeze mixed with milk. Kanye West wants freedom\u2014white freedom. I could only have seen it there, on the waxed hardwood floor of my elementary-school auditorium, because I was young then, barely 7 years old, and cable had not yet come to the city, and if it had, my father would not have believed in it. Yes, it had to have happened like this, like folk wisdom, because when I think of that era, I do not think of MTV, but of the futile attempt to stay awake and navigate the yawning whiteness of Friday Night Videos, and I remember that there were no VCRs among us then, and so it would have had to have been there that I saw it, in the auditorium that adjoined the cafeteria, where after the daily serving of tater tots and chocolate milk, a curtain divider was pulled back and all the kids stormed the stage. And I would have been there among them, awkwardly uprocking, or worming in place, or stiffly snaking, or back-spinning like a broken rotor, and I would have looked up and seen a kid, slightly older, facing me, smiling to himself, then moving across the floor by popping up alternating heels, gliding in reverse, walking on the moon. A recent spate of #MeToo stories serves as yet another reminder of the centrifugal forces of talented men. On Monday evening, The New Yorker published yet more proof that the #MeToo moment continues apace: a report containing the testimony of four women accusing the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, of a range of physical and emotional abuses. The story, under the powerhouse co-byline of Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow, was striking\u2014and nauseating\u2014for several reasons, among them allegations of hitting, of threatening, of racism. One of the other reasons, though, was this line: \u201cAfter the former girlfriend ended the relationship, she told several friends about the abuse. A number of them advised her to keep the story to herself, arguing that Schneiderman was too valuable a politician for the Democrats to lose.\u201d Marchers from last year\u2019s Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville who attacked a black counter-protester made a claim that has often worked for police officers: They acted in self-defense. The photographs of the beating show DeAndre Harris curled up in a ball on the floor of a parking lot trying to protect his face and body as the men around him, some armed with boards or pipes, strike him repeatedly. The men beating Harris were there to attend the white-nationalist rally in Charlottesville last August, where one counter-protester, Heather Heyer, was killed when a car drove into the crowd. Harris, who survived the beating with eight staples in his skull, might have been the second. To an uninformed observer, the picture may look like an image of mob violence. But to many of the men beating Harris and their attorneys, it shows something else: Men acting in self defense. \u201cTo be honest, I was terrified,\u201d Jacob Scott Goodwin, one of the men arrested for beating Harris told the jury during his trial. \u201cI\u2019d probably perish or be sent to the hospital and be terribly hurt.\u201d The new music video from Childish Gambino weaponizes the viewer\u2019s instinctive bodily empathy. \u201cThis Is America\u201d isn\u2019t the first time that Donald Glover, as his musical alter ego Childish Gambino, has harnessed dance in service of surrealism. But the art form has a conspicuous symbolic significance in the artist\u2019s latest single, which Glover debuted on Saturday Night Live: The song\u2019s emphasis on dance was apparent in his live performance on the show, in the cover art for the track, and in the remarkable music video itself, which has more than 36 million views on YouTube as of publication. In the video, a grinning, shirtless Glover dances through a giant warehouse, occasionally accompanied by black school children in uniform, as chaotic scenes of violence unfold behind him\u2014and are sometimes enacted by him. What happens when a Pakistani American writer goes deep into the West Bank? I was here to report on Jewish settlers, the 600,000 citizens of Israel living beyond its pre-1967 borders. My main concern was whether the normally guarded and cautious settler community would open up and talk to me: a brown-skinned, practicing Muslim from the United States. I. The Old City Should I lie to an Israeli soldier in order to be allowed to pray? This was a theological dilemma I never studied in Sunday school, one I never thought I would have to confront. Anxious and on edge, the soldier was standing in front of me, rifle in hand, blocking my way, and all I had to do was tell him I was 50 years old, and then I could pray at one of Islam\u2019s holiest sites. One minor problem: I\u2019m 37. The question is less whether a dress or an idea is borrowed, than the uses to which it\u2019s then put. Meet the Death Metal Cowboys of Botswana. In black leather decorated with metal studs, they play a pounding style of music that people who know more than me trace to the British band \u201cVenom\u201d and its 1981 album Welcome to Hell. Question: Is this cultural appropriation? Why or why not? The question is inspired by a spasm of social-media cruelty that caught wide attention last week. A young woman in Utah bought a Chinese-style dress to wear to her high school formal. She posted some photographs of herself on her personal Instagram page\u2014and suddenly found herself the target of virulent online abuse. For once, the story has a happy ending. Good sense and kindness prevailed, and instead of her prom being ruined, the young woman exited the dance buoyed by worldwide support and affirmation, most of all from within China. Some researchers believe that the microbiome may play a role in regulating how people think and feel. By now, the idea that gut bacteria affect a person\u2019s health is not revolutionary. Many people know that these microbes influence digestion, allergies, and metabolism. The trend has become almost commonplace: New books appear regularly detailing precisely which diet will lead to optimum bacterial health. But these microbes\u2019 reach may extend much further, into the human brains. A growing group of researchers around the world are investigating how the microbiome, as this bacterial ecosystem is known, regulates how people think and feel. Scientists have found evidence that this assemblage\u2014about a thousand different species of bacteria, trillions of cells that together weigh between one and three pounds\u2014could play a crucial role in autism, anxiety, depression, and other disorders. The talk-radio host\u2019s willingness to indulge the fantasy of a mob marching on D.C. to oust Robert Mueller can be called many things\u2014but not \u201cconservative.\u201d Talk radio\u2019s Rush Limbaugh delighted at the expansive twists and turns of the independent counsel investigation of Bill Clinton, cheering it all the way to impeachment, despite polls suggesting Americans wanted Congress to censure the president and move on. He met Barack Obama\u2019s election by declaring that he wanted him to fail, then allied with men who tried to discredit Obama by falsely stating he was born abroad. But now that the nation\u2019s leading birther, Donald Trump, is in the White House, Limbaugh purports to be outraged by what he calls efforts to undermine and unseat a duly elected president. In recent segments on his show, he has claimed that Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation is \u201cactually a cover-up for all of the things the Obama administration and the Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee engaged in to try to taint the election,\u201d and additionally, that \u201cif these people don\u2019t like the way you voted, they\u2019re gonna just throw it out. They\u2019re gonna do whatever they can to undermine it and sabotage it, \u2019cause they don\u2019t like the result.\u201d Seth Meyers on Saturday Night Live, Obama, Oprah 2020, and whether media elites try too hard to feel the pain of Trump voters In 2011, the comedian Seth Meyers, then the head writer for Saturday Night Live and host of the show\u2019s \u201cWeekend Update\u201d news roundup, mocked Donald Trump at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner. \u201cDonald Trump has been saying that he will run for president as a Republican,\u201d Meyers said, as Trump sat stone-faced in the audience, \u201cwhich is surprising, since I just assumed he was running as a joke.\u201d That same evening, President Barack Obama roasted Trump at length. The evening\u2019s jokes\u2014and the idea that they spurred Trump to run in 2016\u2014have become Washington lore. Meyers, who since 2014 has hosted Late Night on NBC, still refuses to pull any punches where Trump is concerned. In January, he hosted the Golden Globes and, in a clear callback to his 2011 mockery of Trump\u2019s presidential ambitions, winkingly berated Oprah Winfrey, telling her that she doesn\u2019t have what it takes to be president.

The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to roll back regulations within 60 legislative days of introduction, a process that today\u2019s resolution would apply to the internet rules introduced by FCC chairman Ajit Pai in December.

I love visual art and find it hugely inspiring. Unfortunately, reading art books is too much of a context switch to be a regular distraction, while museums are only appropriate for the rare trip. Instagram helps, but it only lets you see content from artists you follow. There\u2019s still the 99% of art history beyond that sliver! Sourcing art wasn\u2019t the problem. For years, I had been keeping a fairly large folder of inspiring images from places such as Imgur albums, RuTracker museum collections, \/r\/ImaginaryNetwork, and \/r\/museum. But leafing through them wasn\u2019t enough: I needed to put them into a regular and random rotation in a place that was just out of eyeshot, but without becoming an overt distraction. In 2015, I finally solved the problem by building an app called Backgroundifier, which converted arbitrary-size images into wallpapers by superimposing them onto attractive, blurred backgrounds. By pairing an Automator Folder Action with the native wallpaper cycling functionality of macOS, I could now drop arbitrary images into a directory on my desktop and have them automatically show up in my wallpaper rotation. Peeking at an image was as simple as invoking the Show Desktop shortcut, and if I wanted to see something new, all I had to do was switch to a new Space. For several years, this scheme worked perfectly fine. But recently, my collection had grown to over 500 images, and I found myself bumping into some slight annoyances. For example, I had no way to retrieve the filename of the current wallpaper, to remove an image from rotation, or to mark it as a favorite. Every maintenance task had to be performed manually. Finally, I decided to build a menu bar app that would solve all my problems through a unified interface: BackgroundifierBuddy. BackgroundifierBuddy expects your images to be organized into two directories: one containing your source images, and the other containing their converted, Backgroundified counterparts. This latter directory should be the directory selected for your wallpaper rotation in System Preferences. To start with, right-clicking on the menu bar icon shows your desktop, and right-clicking again moves onward to the next image. Moving the cursor away from the icon hides the desktop. With automatic conversion enabled, images dropped into the Source directory are immediately converted into wallpapers in the Output directory, just so long as the app is running. This means that obscure Folder Actions are no longer necessary for automatic conversion to work. If the current wallpaper is based in the Output directory, and if it has a counterpart in the Source directory, a number of maintenance tasks become available. If you\u2019ve grown tired of an image in your rotation, you can click Delete to trash it together with its source image. If you want to save it for later, or if find that it needs some tweaking, you can click Archive to delete the wallpaper image and move the source image into the Archive directory. (Holding Option allows you to archive the image while still keeping it in rotation.) Clicking Favorite adds a custom Finder tag to the source image, making it easier to locate later. Finally, Refresh Wallpaper Cache restarts the Dock (which seems to sometimes be necessary to update the wallpaper rotation with new images), while Toggle Desktop Icons shows and hides the icons on your desktop for better image visibility.  I was going for simplicity with my solution, and this is just about as simple as it gets: your bog-standard OS wallpaper cycling functionality and a helper app that builds on basic file system commands. No complexity, no hassles, and everything just works! Backgroundifier still costs a buck on the App Store, but BackgroundifierBuddy is free and open source. You can find the latest release here. Enjoy! Although deceptively simple on the surface, the code behind BackgroundifierBuddy has eluded me for some time. The reason is that there\u2019s no public way to query the current wallpaper image when a directory is selected. You can try calling desktopImageURL on NSWorkspace.shared, but this will only return the directory itself, not the displayed image. In the past, you could pull this info from the com.apple.desktop defaults, but this is no longer an option. Starting with Mavericks, the wallpaper settings are stored in a desktoppicture.db SQLite file located in the ~\/Library\/Application Support\/Dock directory. The layout of this file is a tiny bit confusing, and you can read more about it here. In brief, each image in the data table is associated with a Space UUID and display UUID pair. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no indication of which UUID the current Space might be associated with, nor are the UUIDs stored in order. (So if a new Space is created and then moved over a few spots, it becomes impossible to tell which one it is from the database alone.) What\u2019s needed is a way to get the UUIDs of the current Space and display, and the classic way to do this is to query the com.apple.spaces defaults. Unfortunately, the data returned appears to be subtly incorrect. Among other faults, the \u201cCurrent Space\u201d UUID is usually out of date and the \u201cDisplay Identifier\u201d UUID is outright wrong, at least on my machine. To get the real info dictionary for Spaces, you have to call the private CGSCopyManagedDisplaySpaces function. This gives you up-to-date UUIDs for both the current Space and display. With these UUIDs in tow, there\u2019s now enough info to run a query against the desktoppicture.db file and retrieve the current wallpaper. Fortunately, we don\u2019t even have to go this far. After sleuthing around on Github for some relevant keywords\u2014_CGSDefaultConnection together with \u201cwallpaper\u201d, I think\u2014I found a scant few references to a private function that did exactly what I needed: DesktopPictureCopyDisplayForSpace. Together with CGSGetDisplayForUUID, you can use this function to retrieve a dictionary with all the wallpaper info for a given space. Caveat emptor: all this stuff might break in a future macOS release. Fortunately, I\u2019m not making any changes through the private APIs, only requesting data. The only edit I make to the wallpaper settings is when refreshing the current image, and this is simply done by calling the public NSWorkspace method setDesktopImageURL with arguments mirrored from desktopImageURL and desktopImageOptions. Toggle Desktop Icons does make a change to the com.apple.finder defaults, but this functionality is entirely optional. Note that sandboxing restrictions only allow command line calls to Backgroundifier to process images in the user\u2019s Pictures directory and subdirectories. I haven\u2019t yet found a way to expand an app\u2019s sandbox when called from a non-sandboxed app, so this restriction carries over to the selection of Source and Output directories. (Let me know if you know a way to expand an app\u2019s sandbox from another app!) If this poses a problem, you\u2019ll be able to find a non-sandboxed, command-line version of the Backgroundifier executable in a zip file in the Resources subdirectory of the Backgroundifier.app bundle. Point to it in the BackgroundifierBuddy preferences and you should be good to go for arbitrary Source and Output directories.

This was evident at Google\u2019s I\/O keynote, where the company unveiled that its AI can now make phone calls on your behalf, booking salon appointments or restaurant reservations. The demo was stunning, both because of how human this next-level chatbot sounded and how dystopian the world would be with our robot imposters flooding the phone lines. But as I walked out of the conference yesterday, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the person on the other end of the line. When did human service workers become Google\u2019s to experiment on? My first job was in the summer of 2004. I waitressed, took phone orders, and packed takeout food at my parents\u2019 restaurant. That job has taught me to have empathy for those working in the service industry. There will always be a subset of people who are inexplicably rude, whether it\u2019s by verbally harassing waiters or refusing to tip because they didn\u2019t like the food. Modern technology has further enabled our entitlement, with the promise of apps and services that can customize, personalize, and cater to our every need, no matter how small. This has led us to disregard the humans fulfilling our demands. Last fall, Seamless released a series of ads that highlighted over-the-top special instructions its customers made to restaurants and delivery folks. The branding agency called it \u201chilarious.\u201d I think the people reading these instructions would say otherwise. With Google\u2019s AI assistant making calls on our behalf, I worry it will become easier for us to abuse small businesses. If it\u2019s as simple as telling Google Duplex to make an appointment, it\u2019s just as easy to constantly reschedule or not show up altogether because there\u2019s no connection between you and the human worker who picked up the phone to arrange your reservation. You don\u2019t feel bad for the number of requests and changes when someone (or something) else is doing it for you. You don\u2019t even have to say \u201cPlease.\u201d Adding a layer of communication between businesses and their customers can also financially impact the former. On our way home from Google I\/O yesterday, my colleague Nick Statt told me about how he used Facebook\u2019s M to order breakfasts every day to test the service. After about a week, the shop owner recognized Nick and asked him to order direct if he could, because M was processing his request through Eat24, which takes a cut from every order. In many ways, technology has widened the gap between the rich and the poor and has coarsened the behavior one exudes toward the other. Never was this more clear than when former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick was caught on video berating a driver on his platform for asking about why UberBlack prices had dropped. When you think of the on-demand economy as just that \u2014 something you get on-demand, regardless of who fulfills it as long as you\u2019re paying \u2014 it\u2019s easier to forget about underpaid employees working around the clock to make your wishes happen. Google is billing Duplex as a way to promote Time Well Spent\u2122 and lessen language barrier issues so that we can all be free to engage with the world outside our digital screens. That\u2019s one optimistic end of the spectrum. In reality, it\u2019s more likely that this technology, like others before it, will just encourage us to further distance and focus only on ourselves in the world within a bubble.

At Machine Box, most of my technical work involves building various APIs. Machine Learning is complicated and inaccessible to most developers, so my job is to tell a simple story through the API endpoints, and we\u2019ve had great feedback so far. The way I have written services has changed over the years, so I wanted to share how I write the services today\u200a\u2014\u200ain case the patterns are useful to you and your work. All of my components have a single server structure that usually ends up looking something like this: I have a single file inside every component called routes.go where all the routing can live: This is handy because most code maintenance starts with a URL and an error report\u200a\u2014\u200aso one glance at routes.go will direct us where to look. My HTTP handlers hang off the server: Handlers can access the dependencies via the s server variable. My handler functions don\u2019t actually handle the requests, they return a function that does. This gives us a closure environment in which our handler can operate: Be sure to only read the shared data, if handlers are modifying anything, remember you\u2019ll need a mutex or something to protect it. If a particular handler has a dependency, take it as an argument. The format variable is accessible to the handlers. I use http.HandlerFunc in almost every case now, rather than http.Handler. They are more or less interchangeable, so just pick whichever is simpler to read. For me, that\u2019s http.HandlerFunc. Middleware functions take an http.HandlerFunc and return a new one that can run code before and\/or after calling the original handler\u200a\u2014\u200aor it can decide not to call the original handler at all. The logic inside the handler can optionally decide whether to call the original handler or not\u200a\u2014\u200ain the example above, if IsAdmin is false, the handler will return an HTTP 404 Not Found and return (abort); notice that the h handler is not called. If IsAdmin is true, execution is passed to the h handler that was passed in. Usually I have middleware listed in the routes.go file: If an endpoint has its own request and response types, usually they\u2019re only useful for that particular handler. If that\u2019s the case, you can define them inside the function. This declutters your package space and allows you to name these kinds of types the same, instead of having to think up handler-specific versions. In test code, you can just copy the type into your test function and do the same thing. Or\u2026 If your request\/response types are hidden inside the handler, you can just declare new types in your test code. This is an opportunity to do a bit of storytelling to future generations who will need to understand your code. For example, let\u2019s say we have a Person type in our code, and we reuse it on many endpoints. If we had a \/greet endpoint, we might only care about their name, so we can express this in test code: It\u2019s clear from this test, that the only field we care about is the Name of the person. If I have to do anything expensive when preparing the handler, I defer it until when that handler is first called. This improves application startup time. sync.Once ensures the code is only executed one time, and other calls (other people making the same request) will block until it\u2019s finished. Our server type is very testable. I hope the items I covered in this post make sense, and help you in your work. If you disagree or have other ideas, please tweet me.

A rating on iTunes goes a long way. Subscribe via iTunes or RSS. As founders, a lot of our identities get wrapped up in our companies. Certainly within our industries, but even to family and friends it\u2019s how people know us. And over time, we sort of become our companies. Most founders or CEOs are the \u201cface\u201d of their businesses and eventually they\u2019re inseparable. Maybe that\u2019s fine in the short run if you\u2019re trying to go hard for 2-3 years then bank on some big exit, but if you\u2019re in the business of businessing (i.e. an entrepreneur), you just can\u2019t do that long term. It\u2019s unsustainable and unhealthy. Being wholly consumed by your company hurts not only you and the people around you, but even the company itself. When you don\u2019t take a step back, you get caught in the startup echo chamber. Your brain needs a break. Sleep is the most regular forced break your brain gets, but you need it more frequently than that. You need waking hours and days to let your mind organize all the thoughts and process them. When you\u2019re working 10-15 hour days, 6-7 days a week with no breaks and nothing else to focus on, you lose the forest for the trees. You become incapable of addressing problems efficiently because you never take a step back to get fresh perspective. Your company will operate less and less efficiently because you\u2019ll make more and more bad decisions. So what do you do about that? How do you have a healthy balance of working hard on your company, giving it the attention it, your team and your customers deserve and making efficient, wise decisions while also not running yourself in to the ground? I\u2019d like to introduce you to a little thing called a \u201chobby\u201d.  I know. It\u2019s offensive I\u2019d even suggest that. But you need it. Hobbies are an amazing way to give your brain that crucial break it needs to organize all the bits, not so that you\u2019re distracted from your business but so you can actually be better at your job. I\u2019d also argue it will make you a better, well-rounded human being. When you\u2019re done with that business or have moved on to other things, what\u2019s left is that you\u2019ll still be an interesting person and not just the shell of your former business. The biggest concerns I hear from people who ask about this (and yes, I\u2019ve had dozens upon dozens of messages from people expressing concern that I have hobbies), are around our team and our customers. One of the biggest potential issues is that your team thinks you aren\u2019t committed to the business. That you\u2019re distracted. But ultimately this is a culture issue. At Baremetrics, we highly encourage hobbies and side projects. It\u2019s part of the fabric of our company. Heck, it\u2019s one of the first questions I ask during the interview process when hiring. \u201cWhat hobbies do you have outside of work?\u201d Because the last thing I want is you designing or coding all day and night and then getting burned out and rage-quitting. Many of the 1-on-1\u2019s I have with our team actually involve me giving feedback on side projects\/hobbies. I want the folks on our team to not just love the work they do but to love life\u2026and their life needs to consist of a lot more than just working at Baremetrics. If I encouraged my team to have hobbies while I ran myself in to the ground, that\u2019d be quite hypocritical of me. In addition, the fact is, our hobbies many times do circle back and benefit the company as well! Tyler, our Frontend Engineer, has a whole host of side projects from a pixel glyph trading game, to a Dropbox-based blogging platform, to a tiny web traffic analytics app. He\u2019s also a mentor on Thinkful. Building all of these things and teaching others absolutely makes him a better frontend engineer. And Fried, one of our Backend Engineers, loves machine learning and AI. So much so, that in his spare time he\u2019s completed both Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence degrees! And you better believe we\u2019re making use of the things he\u2019s learned from that. \ud83d\ude42 I joked earlier about it being offensive that I\u2019d suggest having interests outside of work, but for better or worse, to some people it really is.  Now, I get it. When something isn\u2019t working right for a customer, especially paying customers, they expect for things to be fixed as soon as possible. Totally understandable. So when that customer sees the CEO posting about making concrete planters or hacking on a music industry simulation game on the weekends, it implies we\u2019re not focusing on fixing their problem.\u00a0 The issue here is that there will always be issues for someone. That\u2019s the nature of software. You\u2019ll never be 100% bug-free. So if you say \u201call hands on deck!\u201d every time there\u2019s a bug, you\u2019ll literally be all hands on deck all of the time. Which, as we\u2019ve already covered, isn\u2019t healthy for anyone. As you\u2019re likely painfully aware, you can\u2019t please everyone. Don\u2019t let customers guilt you in to having an unhealthy balance in life. What hobbies? Need some ideas for hobbies? Here are some of the things folks on our team do for hobbies. What about you?

While acknowledging the space agency's lamentable efforts to return to the Moon after the Apollo program, Bridenstine also promised that this time would be different. In 1989, President George H.W. Bush announced the\u00a0Space Exploration Initiative, a long-range commitment toward the human exploration of deep space, beginning with a return to the Moon. \"Major parts of that policy went forward, but establishing permanence on the Moon was abandoned,\" Bridenstine said Tuesday. Then, in 2004, President George W. Bush\u00a0announced a bold plan to send humans back to the Moon, where they would learn how to operate in deep space and then go on to Mars. This became the Constellation program. Again, major parts of that policy went forward, Bridenstine said. But NASA abandoned the drive back to the Moon. Before the US Senate confirmed pilot and former congressman Bridenstine, the Trump administration announced a plan to send humans back to the Moon. \"To many, this may sound similar to our previous attempts to get to the Moon,\" Bridenstine said Tuesday. \"However, times have changed.\u00a0This will not be Lucy and the football again.\" How have times changed? During his brief address, Bridenstine listed several technologies that he believes have lowered the cost of a lunar return. These include the miniaturization of electronics that will allow for smaller robotic vehicles, the decreasing costs of launch, private investment in spaceflight, commercial interest in lunar resources, and new ways of government contracting. (Bridenstine did not mention the Space Launch System rocket or the Orion spacecraft). NASA has kicked off its efforts to return to the Moon by asking the commercial space industry to help the agency land scientific payloads on the surface of the Moon. By using commercial services, NASA hopes to lower the cost of studying the Moon and getting astronauts back to the lunar surface by the mid-2020s. Among the big questions Bridenstine will have to address, if he really is serious about sending humans back to the Moon, is whether to continue with the \"Gateway\" concept in lunar orbit. This waystation has been criticized by some as \"make work\" for the Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System rocket, rather than a needed stepping stone to the Moon. The new administration will also have to consider the extent to which Orion and the SLS rocket are involved in NASA's exploration efforts, as they cost so much to fly.

On the other hand, maybe you shouldn't. Yesterday at its I\/O conference, the search giant unveiled two creepy A.I. features: one that finishes your sentences in Gmail and another that literally makes phone calls for you, using a deceptively human voice. As a tech geek I'm impressed, but as a human who values communication, I'm bummed out. The language you choose when writing and the intonations you make when speaking are your own. If a computer does the talking for you, then your \"word\" isn't really yours. Google's new Smart Compose feature helps you finish your sentences. For example, if you start typing \"Hav\" at the beginning of a message, it suggests completing the phrase as \"Haven't seen you in a while.\" If you start writing \"Does next T,\" it suggests that you say \"Does next Tuesday work for you?\"  On the face of it, these suggestions seem innocuous. If you really meant to say \"haven't seen you in a while,\" you can save yourself two dozen keystrokes by hitting tab. But what if, you really were thinking about saying \"Haven't hung with you in a minute,\" which means essentially the same thing (\"a minute\" means a long time in context), but is devoid of personality? Chances are that to, save yourself the effort, you'll just start accepting Google's suggestions to save yourself the hassle. All of a sudden your \"voice\" is the same as everyone else's.  If, as a recipient, you know that your conversation partner is using canned text, everything they say has less meaning. How excited can you be about getting birthday greetings on Facebook when you know that none of your so-called friends actually remembered your special day? And while it's always good to save your fingers from extra strokes, your sentiments are meaningless if you can't even take 3 seconds to enter them on your own. I tried writing a sample termination letter using Gmail and here's what I got. Smart Compose is fairly conservative right now. I tried typing some insults or highly-personal things and it didn't suggest anything. But I'm sure that Google will refine this tool so that it's much more aggressive in the future. It's important to note that there's nothing inherently unethical about using auto suggestions, but it still takes \"you\" out of your communication.  \"I suspect that Google\u2019s automatic writing will be banal but not unethical. ,\" former New York Times Ethicist Randy Cohen told me. \"Much email writing is already lackluster in both form and content.\"To be fair, Smart Compose isn't the first feature to make suggestions. Gmail users on phones have seen suggested replies for a while now and a number of other platforms also suggest words and phrases. However, Smart Compose shows that this trend is growing and starting to transform how we write. Soon computers will go beyond writing and literally speak for you. Demoing a\u00a0feature it calls Duplex, Google played a recording of a customer calling a restaurant to reserve a table. The customer, who turns out to be a bot, sounds exactly like a real person, even using verbal ticks like \"um\" that make it sound completely realistic. It has a complete conversation, asking questions and responding to queries from the person at the restaurant. You can check out the audio of a sample hair salon call below (courtesy of our sister site, Tom's Guide).  Frankly, I'd like Google Assistant to make some of the more soul-sucking calls I have to endure. Perhaps it can call and argue with the insurance company about doctor bills. Then it can answer calls from a relative and feign interest in the gossip she wants to share.

The paper has accused Tidal, which is primarily owned by Beyonce\u2019s husband Jay-Z, of inflating its subscriber numbers in the past, claims the company has denied; in a statement to Variety, it also denied the latest accusations. Tidal, which has rarely shared its data publicly, had a streaming exclusive on West\u2019s album for its first six weeks of release and continues to be the exclusive streamer for Beyonce\u2019s album. It claimed that West\u2019s album had been streamed 250 million times in its first 10 days of release in February of 2016, while claiming it had just 3 million subscribers \u2014 a claim that would have meant every subscriber played the album an average of eight times per day; and that Beyonce\u2019s album was streamed 306 million times in its first 15 days of release in April of 2016.  These claims led the Norwegian paper to investigate the service\u2019s numbers and report that it was intentionally inflating its subscriber count, a report supported by research from British firm Midia, which estimated that Tidal\u2019s total number of subscribers was closer to 1 million globally. Today\u2019s report, according to MBW\u2019s translation, says that \u201cBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s and Kanye West\u2019s listener numbers on Tidal have been manipulated to the tune of several hundred million false plays\u2026 which has generated massive royalty payouts at the expense of other artists.\u201d It bases this claim on data contained within a hard drive it obtained that \u201ccontains \u2018billions of rows of [internal TIDAL data]: times and song titles, user IDs and country codes.\u201d Tidal has disputed the information on the hard drive, but the paper asserts that it matches information received by labels for the time period. In a statement provided to Variety, Tidal responded: \u201cThis is a smear campaign from a publication that once referred to our employee as an \u2018Israeli Intelligence officer\u2019 and our owner as a \u2018crack dealer.\u2019\u00a0We expect nothing less from them than this ridiculous story, lies and falsehoods. The information was stolen and manipulated and we will fight these claims vigorously.\u201d The quotes reference descriptions of Jay-Z and Tidal COO\/Roc Nation executive Lior Tibon in a previous\u00a0Dagens N\u00e6ringsliv\u00a0article, which were technically accurate at one time but are decades out of date. The paper supported its findings with data from NTNU \u2013 the Norwegian University of Science and Technology \u2013 which it says has \u201cassembled some of Norway\u2019s leading experts in data security and cybercrime prevention.\u201d Its report reads in part, \u201cUsing advanced statistical analysis of the data provided by DN, NTNU determined that there had in fact been a manipulation of the data at particular times due to the large presence of similar duplicate records occurring for a large percentage of the userbase that was active at any given time. In reviewing the data, in isolation from any other records or logs, it was not possible to determine the exact means of manipulation; however, the absence of records with unreadable data suggested it was not an external Structured Query Language Injection (SQLi) vector based attacked, but rather manipulation from within the streaming service itself. Due to the targeted nature and extent of the manipulation, it is very unlikely that this manipulation was solely the result of a code based bug or other system anomaly. The following analysis shows in detail why this conclusion is the most likely conclusion and further, the nature and extent it is suspected that the manipulation has affected the accuracy of the data \u2026 The manipulation appears targeted towards a very specific set of track IDs, related to two distinct albums,\u201d \u201cPablo\u201d and \u201cLemonade.\u201d The report can be viewed here.  Additionally, the paper contacted several Tidal users and presented them with logs of their individual play counts taken from the hard drive, which said one user played tracks from \u201cLemonade\u201d 180 times in 24 hours. \u201cNo, that can\u2019t be right,\u201d the user, Tiare Faatea in Washington, DC, said. According to the paper, Tidal paid Beyonce\u2019s label Sony more than $4 million for April and May of 2016, of which \u201cLemonade\u201d accounted for $2.5 million; it also paid West\u2019s label Universal 3.2 million euros, 2 million for \u201cPablo.\u201d The paper says Tidal has strongly denied \u201cmanipulating streaming figures or tampering with royalty payments,\u201d adding that \u201cThe lawyers claim that NTNU\u2019s report is based on false assumptions. TIDAL believes that the data the report is based on is stolen, incomplete for the relevant periods, that DN has changed the data and has lied to NTNU about the origin and content of the data.\u201d The company\u2019s lawyer at Reed Smith, Jordan Siev, is quoted as saying:\u00a0\u201cAs each of these assumptions is demonstrably false, you and DN lied to NTNU to procure a study\u201d. Reps for Beyonce, West, Sony and Universal either declined or did not immediately respond to Variety\u2019s request for comment.

If you haven\u2019t used Matrix before, It\u2019s a newish instant messaging protocol which supports\nmany features you would expect from an IM platform today and it is also federated allowing\nanyone to set up their own Matrix \u201chomeserver\u201d and message anyone else using Matrix. I\u2019ll just explain some of the common terms relating to Matrix: When I started using Matrix back when Riot was called Vector, I found it really uncomfortable\nto use. It was lacking the level of polish that every other IM app had. And it was also lacking\nmost of the features other apps had. Over the years Matrix has gained almost all the features I\nwant and technically in it\u2019s current state it does everything I need. I want to preface this part by saying that the developers on Matrix have done a really good job\nso far. I have pointed out a lot of negatives of Matrix and Riot in it\u2019s current form but it\u2019s by\nno means bad software. It just has a way to go to improve the UI and speed. Riot supports so many things from text messages to video calls to encrypted groups chats but the\nproblem is while it has all of these features, most don\u2019t\nwork really nicely. When I say that I don\u2019t mean that riot works terrible, it\u2019s actually quite\nfunctional and pretty bug free. The problem is mainly the UI is so far behind the competition\nlike telegram, discord and slack that while Riot has all the same features, they just aren\u2019t\ncomfortable to use. This has improved a lot since a year ago but there still needs to be a massive change in the UI\ndesign to make it comparable to the competition. Another huge issue is how painfully slow the client is. Simple tasks like switching between\ngroups takes up to a second where as on telegram this action finished before my mouse button has\nfinished lifting back up and slack isn\u2019t too far behind. Starting up Riot on web and mobile also\ntakes a painfully long time which can be up to a minute just to get from the splash screen to\nthe app. No other app on my phone even has a loading screen because they all load just about\ninstantly. Now with those issues out of the way I\u2019ll touch on what it\u2019s like to interact with Matrix as a\ndeveloper. Interacting with the Matrix client-server protocol is a joy. The protocol is based on top of JSON\nand HTTP making it trivial to use from just about any language. Sending a message to a room on\nMatrix can be done with a single line of bash using curl. The Matrix protocol is also very extensible and can be used for much more than just IM. Each\nmessage starts with some basic fields like the sender, event ID and destination room but then\nthere is a block for content and a content type. Many content types are defined in the spec\nincluding messages, join\/quits, images and other kinds of events you would see in an IM client.\nBut this content block can contain any valid JSON so you are free to build your own protocols on\ntop of Matrix. An example being IoT device control by sending events over Matrix. This ensures\nthe transmission of commands is secure and encrypted without having to implement anything\nyourself. Over all I am very excited for the future of Matrix and Riot and I will continue to use it and\nfollow it\u2019s development. The design and specification for Matrix currently are great. The client\nneeds a LOT of work on the UI and speed but once that comes through I feel Riot\/Matrix will be\nperfect platform to recommend to those looking to switch away from proprietary and privacy\ninvasive messaging services.

It'll finish up explaining how we're going to solve it, and ~I'll write part 2 when it is solved~ part two explains the solution. Whenever talking about API specifications it is impossible to avoid mentioning OpenAPI and JSON Schema. They're the two main solutions for any sort of API that doesn't have a type system forcibly jammed into it by default. Often you'll need OpenAPI for one thing, and JSON Schema for another. OpenAPI has amazing API documentation tools, fancy SDK generators, and handles loads of API-specific functionality that JSON Schema doesn't even go near. It also has a focus on keeping this static, for strictly typed languages, where properties should be 1 type and 1 type only. JSON Schema focuses on very flexible data modeling with the same sort of validation vocabulary as OpenAPI, but for more flexible data sets. Whilst it doesn't focus just on APIs, by using more advanced vocabularies like JSON Hyper-Schema it can model a fully RESTful API and its hypermedia controls (HATEOAS). JSON Schema can offer server-defined client-side validation, and a bunch of other fantastic stuff that OpenAPI doesn't really aim to do. Over the last year I've been chasing the perfect workflow, and one of my main requirements when evaluating the common API specs was JSON Schema support. The situation overall was pretty bleak, not just in supporting JSON Schema, but a lot of tooling was just\u2026 not great. Eight months after that article things are better, and the design-first API specification workflow I've been dreaming of has been maturing around me. to a point where I'm really happy about most stuff! OpenAPI is often described as an extension of JSON Schema, but both specs have changed over time and grown independently. OpenAPI v2 was based on JSON Schema draft v4 with a long list of deviations, but OpenAPI v3 shrank that list, upping their support to draft v5 and making the list of discrepancies shorter. Despite OpenAPI v3 closing the gap, the issue of JSON Schema divergence has not been resolved fully, and with newer drafts of JSON Schema coming out, the divergence is actually getting worse over time. Currently OpenAPI is still on draft 5, and JSON Schema has released draft 8.  I've been punting this issue for a while in my articles and recommendations at work. The hope was that by the time folks at work had upgraded to v3, there might be a v3.1 out solving the situation, but that has not come to pass. Now I find myself suggesting folks find some way to convert one to the other, or try to write JSON Schema that is compatible with OpenAPI.  The latter can be done, but eventually you'll get bit by something. At work we've been writing JSON Schema files, using them for contract testing and a bunch of other stuff, then rendering them as part of our OpenAPI Docs with ReDoc. ReDoc will let you use type: [string, null], but now we've got Speccy linting our packages, it's reporting that as invalid OpenAPI\u2026 If I change that to valid OpenAPI and use type: string with nullable: true instead, validators like Speccy will be happy, but my JSON Schema contract tests will break as they no longer know that null is an acceptable value for that field. This error was the final straw for me. At work I have been recommending everyone enable Speccy on CircleCI to (amongst other things) make sure we're writing valid OpenAPI, and I am failing to write valid OpenAPI in an API I manage. I'm also a little tired of explaining this awkward difference to people who would like to use some JSON Schema-based tools. After grumping at Darrel Miller (a contributor to OpenAPI) and others on the APIs You Won't Hate slack, some good ideas started to pop up. Darrel is going to try and draft up an extension to OpenAPI that could theoretically end up in a future version - like 3.1 or 4.0: This would allow support for various JSON Schema drafts, and any other data model you can think of; including protobuf. The decisions of which data model formats to support would be in the hands of tool vendors. Of course this would increase work for these vendors, and decrease portability for a while as you can only use tools that support your alternate schea, but ultimately solve a lot of problems. There's some stuff to flesh out, and obvious limitations around which schemas can $ref which other schemas, but there is definitely a solution here. It'll take some time to get it done, and in that time we all need a solution. One approach would be trying to use OpenAPI for all the things, write validators and RSpec tools that do this, but we'd have to be 100% OpenAPI for everything, and we'd never get to play with client validation, Hyper-Schema, etc. Another approach would be converting our OpenAPI models to JSON Schema, but that seems a bit lossy. OpenAPI v3 is based on JSON Schema draft v5, and at time of writing JSON Schema is up to draft v8\u2026 This also adds a build step that gets in the way. If you are using JSON Schema for your contract testing, with something like thoughtbot\/json_matchers, you would need to edit your OpenAPI model, run the conversion, then run the tests. Or crowbar a conversion into your test suite, meaning the tool handling the conversion needs to be written in that specific language\u2026 or pipe a shell command to the CLI\u2026 AGH RUN AWAY. No, I think making JSON Schema (latest possible draft) the one and only source of truth for the data model, then \"downgrading\" to a flavour of JSON Schema that OpenAPI likes, is going to be the way to go. To do this, a suite of JavaScript tools are going to be created. Basically I'm going to flip openapi-to-json-schema around. A simple CLI package that will take a JSON Schema draft 4 file, and make it perfectly OpenAPI friendly, stripping out any keywords that would cause harm. Henry Andrews (author of JSON Schema) is going to release this package, to convert files from any draft version to any other by stepping up and down. This will be really handy for all sorts of things, the most obvious use being upgrading schema files when new drafts come out. This package will be used by json-schema-to-openapi to accept input in any JSON Schema draft version, and migrate it to v5 before converting to OpenAPI. Right now Speccy has a few commans: lint, serve, resolve. Lint checks the files are valid, serve creates a HTTP server and renders your docs with ReDoc, and resolve pulls in all the $ref's to create one mega-file. All of these commands could support a -j \/ --json-schema switch, which would send all .json files off to json-schema-to-openapi. Conversion this way should avoid the need for a build step. Changing the JSON Schema data model files mean anything you're using JSON Schema for (contract testing for example) are already happy. Stuff you're doing locally with OpenAPI is usually checking the docs after editing the files, or linting things to see if your changes are ok. Both of these workflows will continue to work once Speccy is passing things through the convertor at run time, and if you do need pure OpenAPI you can use resolve to create a plain OpenAPI file. \ud83d\ude01 So, with the problem well and truly understood and explained, let's get to work on fixing it!

In other words, if Facebook attempts to collect consent in this manner, that consent will be unlawful. European Regulators have been very clear on this point. See for example Article 29 WP guidance on conflation of multiple purposes \nhttps:\/\/iapp.org\/media\/pdf\/resource_center\/20180416_Article29WPGuidelinesonConsent_publishpdf.pdf\u00a0\u2026pic.twitter.com\/pqZr5stVNd Then, a mere 24 days before the application of the #GDPR, $FB's head of privacy announces plans to build \u201cClear History\u201d, with which users can opt-out of Facebook collecting data about their visits to other websites and apps. \nBut the GDPR demands not an opt-out, but an opt-in. Nor is Clear History available to non-Facebook users. \nA further sign of Facebook\u2019s brinksmanship: it said \u201cit will take a few months to build Clear History\u201d, which means that the feature will not be available to users until long after the GDPR has been applied later this month. Facebook is playing a dangerous game of \u201cchicken\u201d with the regulators. Reading through a recent court ruling from the Brussels Court of First Instance shows how dangerous this is for the company. Here are some quotes: \"The court has come to the decision that in all the cases described, Facebook does not obtain any legally valid consent in the sense of Article 5 (a) Privacy Act [Data Protection Directive] and Article 129 ECA [ePrivacy] for the disputed data processing.\" See the ruling text https:\/\/pagefair.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Belgian-Court-judgement.pdf\u00a0\u2026 The Court also made clear that consent requests must be specific: \"Specific means that the expression of will must related to a specific instance or category of data processing and can thus not be obtained on the basis of a general authorization for an open series of processing.\" This part of the ruling was based on Article 1, section 8, of the Belgian Privacy Act, which uses the same formula of words as Article 4, paragraph 11, of the GDPR (\u201cfreely given, specific, informed\u2026\u201d). In other words, the Court is upholding a standard that is virtually identical to the standard that will apply under the GDPR. Facebook\u2019s new GDPR consent dialogue faces the same problem, and is unlawful for the same reason. The Court also found that Facebook users are not clearly told what \u201cpurposes\u201d Facebook processes the personal data for. Nor does it clearly explain its use of sensitive data including any personal data that could reveal religious belief, sexual orientation, etc. Facebook has recently gone some way to inform users about the use of personal data concerning their political interests, but this is only a partial solution to a far broader risk for the company. Its handling of sensitive categories of personal data will be a major challenge.pic.twitter.com\/KDzWi3oh4q Unsurprisingly in the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the Court found that Facebook did not properly disclose who it was sharing the data with. The ruling that Facebook was not even complying with its own self-regulatory system. Whatever one\u2019s view of the \u201cadchoices\u201d self-regulatory system, it is quite remarkable that Facebook continued to track people even if they had already used it to opt out.pic.twitter.com\/DlQmfmmMWn The Brussels Court ordered Facebook to pay \u20ac250,000 per day, up to a maximum of \u20ac100 million, until it stopped its unlawful behavior. This was a strong statement. To put this fine in to perspective, consider that Belgium has a population of 11.35 million people, which is only 2% of the population of the EU. At the same value per person, the EU equivalent would be \u20ac12.5 million per day, up to a maximum of \u20ac5 billion. In addition, Facebook was ordered to submit to an independent expert supervising its deletion of all illegal data that it had amassed about every user on Belgian soil. It also had to make sure that third parties to whom it provided illegal data do the same. The Cambridge Analytica scandal shows that this last point about insuring that third parties delete their copies of Facebook\u2019s illegally accumulated data will be impossible for Facebook. Recall that Mark Zuckerberg told US lawmakers: When developers told us they weren\u2019t going to sell data, we thought that was a good representation. But one of the big lessons we\u2019ve learned is that clearly, we cannot just take developer\u2019s word for it. Video this remarkable statement is at  https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?443490-1\/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-testifies-data-protection&live&start=4929#\u00a0\u2026. In other words, Facebook was sharing personal data without any control whatsoever. Johnny Ryan Retweeted Johnny Ryan As I argue in this thread https:\/\/twitter.com\/johnnyryan\/status\/976812663991914496?lang=en\u00a0\u2026 this is no different from what every major website currently does when it sends visitors\u2019 personal data in RTB bid requests. Johnny Ryan added, Even if the original collection of the data had been lawful, this uncontrolled distribution would certainly is not. Again, the parallel with RTB bid requests should give publishers and adtech vendors pause. Important lesson from the Belgian case: what the Article 29 Working Party says matters. #Adtech vendors continue to ignore it at their peril. Although the Court is the arbiter, it relied on the Working Party\u2019s authoritative opinions throughout its ruling. The ruling cited WP opinions on consent (15\/2011), online behavioral advertising (2\/2010), purpose limitation (2\/2013), and data controllers and processors (1\/2010). The requirements of European data protection law have been well illuminated by the public guidance of the Article 29 Working Party for over two decades, and provide an invaluable guide to businesses scrambling to comply with a body of law largely neglected hitherto. The Court also ruled that Facebook cannot reject users who refuse to agree to tracking \u2013 unless the tracking in question is necessary for the service that a user explicitly requests from Facebook.pic.twitter.com\/wvUvPAKT2K This ruling is one of several defeats Facebook has suffered in European courts in recent months. In January, the Berlin Regional Court ruled that Facebook\u2019s approach to consent and terms are unlawful. (See ruling here (in German) https:\/\/pagefair.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Berlin-Court-judgement-German.pdf\u00a0\u2026) In April, the Irish High Court referred important aspects of Facebook\u2019s trans-Atlantic transfers of personal data to the European Court of Justice, once again, for scrutiny. It is likely that worse is to come, unless it significantly changes its approach to data protection. \n Back to top \u2191 \n      Twitter may be over capacity or experiencing a momentary hiccup.

Yet the drug-price hike that initially thrust him into the public spotlight\u2014and infamy\u2014hasn\u2019t budged, according to a sobering report by Kaiser Health News. Further ReadingIt\u2019s 7 years in prison for Martin Shkreli, convicted of fraudThe outlet points out that the retail price for Daraprim (pyrimethamine) is still $750 a pill, up more than 5,000 percent from its previous price of $13.50 per pill. Worse yet, it\u2019s not the only such case. In 2015 alone, more than 300 generic drugs saw prices increase by more than 100 percent. Drug prices are \u201ceasy to raise and harder to lower, particularly if there\u2019s no competition,\u201d Nicholson Price of University of Michigan Law School told KHN. Back in 2015, Shkreli\u2019s former pharmaceutical company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, bought the rights to and dramatically raised the price of Daraprim. It\u2019s an off-patent, decades old drug that treats relatively rare parasitic infections, namely toxoplasmosis, which largely strikes babies and patients with HIV\/AIDS. It costs pennies to make and generates little profit. Only a few thousand patients need it each year. And there was no competition at the time Turing bought the rights. Shkreli saw an opportunity. Virtually overnight, hospitals and patients saw their bills skyrocket. The move was widely derided and heaped piles of scorn on Shkreli. Congressional committees summoned him to Washington to scold and publicly shame him and Turing. Other pharmaceutical companies took great efforts to distance themselves, and some even tried to come up with affordable alternatives\u00a0for Daraprim. Further ReadingTuring\u2019s Martin Shkreli regrets 5,000% price hike\u2014says it wasn\u2019t high enoughStill, despite the fanfare and furor, little changed for Daraprim. Shkreli stepped down from Turing, which renamed itself Vyera Pharmaceuticals. And Shkreli ultimately went to jail in an entirely unrelated case on securities fraud, which prosecutors described as a Ponzi-like scheme involving two hedge funds Shkreli previously managed and another of his pharmaceutical companies, Retrophin. In 2017, Medicaid programs paid an average of $35,556.48 per prescription of Daraprim, according to a KHN analysis. Vyera, like other pharmaceutical companies, has set up patient assistance programs, coupons, and state rebates to lessen the blow. But in the end, insurance companies and governments are still facing the greater costs, which can lead to higher premiums and burdened budgets. You must login or create an account to comment.

I\u2019ve actually been\nthinking about it for years. I\u2019ve always been searching for the optimal way to\nsort through the bajillion things I have to do and remain productive. This all started when, as a programmer, I realized that I had the power to\nautomate the tasks that I found repetitive in my digital life. I would write\nscripts, for example, to do things like organize my photos, clean up my music\nlibrary, and back up my data. Over the years, I\u2019ve developed my own homegrown\napproach to task management, which has included a couple of attempts at writing\na command-line tool to manage my tasks in a way that\u2019s in line with my approach.\nThen, recently, I discovered that there is already a robust command-line tool\nthat does exactly what I need. That tool is Taskwarrior. But before I get into it, here\u2019s a\nbrief dive into the journey that led me to using it. Around the same time that I was starting to write scripts to automate the\nmonotonous parts of my day-to-day life, I was also discovering the joy of Inbox\nZero. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with Inbox Zero, the basic idea is that\nyou endeavor to keep your email inbox empty as much as possible, instead of\nletting emails pile up that you\u2019ll get to \u201clater\u201d (which could be days, months,\nor even years from now, or perhaps never). You can achieve Inbox Zero by being\ndisciplined about reviewing your inbox regularly (at least once a day) and\ntaking action on every email. Taking action on an email can mean deleting or\narchiving it, replying (even if a quick reply is all you have time for), or\nperhaps making a note for yourself on your calendar to do something later. (You might be wondering what Inbox Zero has to do with task management. That\nwill become clear very shortly. Read on!) Sometime around 2013, I discovered an excellent, free service called\nFollowUpThen. The elevator pitch for FollowUpThen is that you can send or\nforward an email to an address like tomorrow@followupthen.com (or\ntomorrow@fut.io, for short) and tomorrow at 6 AM, the email that you sent or\nforwarded will arrive in your inbox, like clockwork. FollowUpThen supports a\nwide variety of time and date formats, many of which are highly\nuseful. I often found myself forwarding an email to 2weeks@fut.io or sending\nan email to september@fut.io, for example. FollowUpThen quickly became the primary tool in my Inbox Zero toolbox. If I had\na lot of work to do and a handful of emails that I just didn\u2019t have time for at\nthe moment, I could use FollowUpThen to \u201csnooze\u201d the emails until a particular\ntime later in the day when I knew I would be more available. I also started to use FollowUpThen as a task manager. For example, if I was\nplanning to mow the lawn on Saturday, I would send an email with the subject\nmow the lawn to saturday@fut.io. Then when Saturday rolled around, I would\nget an email with the subject mow the lawn, and I would have to mow the lawn\nin order to reach Inbox Zero, which motivated me to mow the lawn. After a while, I started wishing that I could see my upcoming tasks ahead of\ntime. I wanted to see into the future just slightly, so that I could mentally\nprepare myself to work on a task that wasn\u2019t due yet. This would be better than\nforgetting that I had a task scheduled, and then BAM \u2013 I get an email,\nsignaling that I needed to do it right now! Now, to be fair, you can see all of your scheduled follow-ups by logging in at\nfollowupthen.com \u2013 and I did that from time to time \u2013 but that\u2019s a little\ncumbersome for something that I\u2019d ideally like to do on a regular basis. Over\ntime, I\u2019ve become more and more accustomed to doing things at the command line.\nI\u2019m already in a terminal most of the time, so it is typically a lot faster for\nme to do something at the command-line as opposed to, say, logging into a\nwebsite, navigating to the right page, and clicking a button. I started pining\nfor a way to manage all of my projects and tasks at the command-line. As I imagined an ideal command-line task management workflow, I found myself\nthinking about the ancient AS400 system that I used in my previous life as a\nclaims adjudicator. I was managing a caseload of anywhere from 50 to 200 claims, each of which had a\nlog of past actions (called log items) and a schedule of upcoming actions\nneeded (called action items). Some of the action items were designated IA,\nwhich meant that Immediate Action was needed. This was really just a way of\ndesignating some action items as being higher priority than others. The best part of the system was the case summary screen. This was a top-level\nsummary of all of my cases, with statistics about how many cases fell into\ncertain categories.  For example, there was a \u201cCases needing immediate action\u201d\ncategory, which displayed the number of cases with Immediate Action follow-up\nactions either due or overdue. There were also useful categories like \u201cCases\nwithout action in 30 days.\u201d When I was working at that job, I developed a highly\nproductive workflow in which I was able to effectively manage large caseloads\nand ensure that the most urgent tasks were done first. My daily process was to\ngo through the categories on the case summary screen in priority order, and\nendeavor to get the number to the right of each category down to zero, over\ntime. I was following the Inbox Zero philosophy with my workload, and it worked\nvery well for me. I wanted to replicate this sort of workflow for day-to-day task management in my\npersonal life. So, I started writing a program that I called ews (named\nafter the Electronic Worksheet System that I had used in my past job). I was\nenvisioning ews as essentially a port of the AS400 system I had used, where\n\u201ccases\u201d (i.e. projects, groups of related tasks) could be managed and summarized\nin priority order. I started writing this tool in ClojureScript targeting\nnode.js, but I got frustrated with the need to use callbacks when\ninterfacing with the node.js ecosystem, which was a show-stopper for me. I was\nplaying with Rust at the time, so I did a basic rewrite in Rust, which I\nwas fairly happy with, although I realized that the strictness of the Rust\ncompiler caused me to work more slowly than I do in less strict languages. I was on the verge of yet another rewrite in Crystal when I finally\ntook a step back and thought about what I really wanted to create. This led me\nto my next iteration, which was different enough that I decided to give it a\ndifferent name. I had a shower-thought that Google Calendar provides a database for events and\nan API for interacting with them, so I could leverage this platform to build my\ntool. So, I started writing tdz as an experiment in that direction. (NB:\nI didn\u2019t get very far, so don\u2019t expect to find much in that repo!) While I was thinking about how my mental model of projects and tasks could map\nonto the Google Calendar API, I also realized that the model could be\nsimplified. I didn\u2019t really need to manage projects; I only needed to manage\nindividual tasks that have scheduled dates and due dates. (If I could organize\nthem into projects, that would be icing on the cake, but it wasn\u2019t a\nrequirement.) With the conceptual model simplified to just tasks, I (finally) started to\nwonder if maybe somebody else had already created something like this. After\nsome googling, I stumbled upon this list of useful command-line\ntools, which included Taskwarrior, a feature-rich task\nmanagement application. So, I decided to give it a try. I\u2019d briefly encountered Taskwarrior before in the past and thought, \u201cThis is\ncool, but how is it different from the other command-line TODO apps I\u2019ve seen?\u201d\nI\u2019d dismissed it as \u201cjust another TODO list app.\u201d At that point, I\u2019d already come across a number of command-line TODO list\nmanagers in the open source space; it\u2019s a fun, easy project that any beginning\nprogrammer can build and get working in a short amount of time. So, by\nassociation, I had come to expect any command-line TODO manager to be simplistic\nand fall short of my task management needs. I didn\u2019t want a tool that would simply keep track of a list of tasks and let me\ncheck them off when I did them.  This is akin to a traditional pen-and-paper\nTODO list; I\u2019ve always hated those because there\u2019s no way to assign dates to\nthings and filter out the noise of backlog tasks that aren\u2019t yet ready for\naction.  It didn\u2019t occur to me that there might be a more sophisticated task\nmanagement CLI tool that had all of the features I needed in order to follow an\n\u201cInbox Zero\u201d style of task management. Taskwarrior turned out to be exactly what\nI needed and more! Adding and listing tasks is, of course, a breeze: The default behavior when you run task is to run the command task next,\nwhich lists your most urgent tasks, sorted by urgency. Tasks can be modified in a number of ways, including, but not limited to: Watch what happens to my task when I designate it as part of the \u201chome\u201d project: Notice that the urgency level changed from 0 to 1! We can see why if we view\ninformation about the task: It turns out that Taskwarrior considers a task to be higher priority if it is\npart of a project, which I think makes sense. I also like this because it\nencourages me to assign a project to tasks whenever possible. For the sake of example, I\u2019ll add another task that has a different project.  I\ncan concisely add the task and assign the project in a single command: Notice that both tasks are the same urgency level (1) because they\u2019re both tasks\nthat have a project, and out-of-the-box, Taskwarrior doesn\u2019t know which tasks\nand projects I consider to be the most urgent. But it turns out that I can\ncustomize that by setting up \u201ccoefficients\u201d that are applied whenever a task\nmeets certain criteria. For example, I can specify that a task is more important\nif it belongs to the \u201chome\u201d project: Now, mowing the lawn is at the top of my list because I\u2019ve configured the \u201chome\u201d\nproject to be more important than others. I chose a coefficient of 2.0 here,\nwhich is rather arbitrary, but the important thing is how that coefficient\ncompares to other coefficients that I\u2019ve defined. For example, if I had another\nproject that I considered even more important, I might give it a coefficient of\n2.5 or 3.0. Taskwarrior considers a number of other factors when determining how urgent a\ngiven task is. Here\u2019s a real example from my tasks: This task is particularly urgent because I\u2019ve designated it as blocking another\ntask by setting depends:25 (25 being the ID of this task) on the other task.\nThe other task won\u2019t show up in my list until I\u2019ve completed this task, which\nmakes this task more urgent. Makes sense. I\u2019ve also marked this task as \u201cactive\u201d by running task 25 start, so that makes\nit more urgent because, I guess, it\u2019s easier to finish a task you\u2019ve already\nstarted, and when you finish a task, that motivates you to keep working on other\ntasks. Taskwarrior also prioritizes \u201cscheduled\u201d tasks over a task that you\u2019ve added\nwithout thinking about when you want to do it, which really means you don\u2019t care\nabout finishing that task as much, when it comes down to it. Older tasks are also given priority, which I think is good because nothing\ndemotivates me more than having really old items on my TODO list, looming on the\nbackburner, taunting me with my inability to complete them. So I appreciate that\nTaskwarrior gives these tasks priority, encouraging me to finish them and move\nonto newer things. These are all good decisions, in my book. With minimal effort, I can enter all\nof my tasks into Taskwarrior and describe them as belonging to projects,\nblocking other tasks, having scheduled dates and due dates, etc., and I can\ntrust Taskwarrior to put them into the priority order that makes the most sense. The most crucial aspect of Taskwarrior, in my opinion, is the way that it allows\nyou to assign dates and times to tasks, both controlling when a task is due\n(which affects how urgent it is) and when it is scheduled (which affects when\nyou start to see it in your list of tasks that are ready to be done). Let\u2019s look at my example tasks again: Right now, it\u2019s almost 9 PM, so mowing the lawn is not really an option. And I\nknow that I\u2019ll be busy tomorrow (Saturday). So, I figure that Sunday is going to\nbe the next time that I can mow the lawn. So, I\u2019ll schedule mowing the lawn for\nSunday: Now, I can list all tasks that are ready for work, sorted by urgency, with the\ntask ready command: Notice that \u201cmow the lawn\u201d is not part of this list. That\u2019s because it\u2019s\nscheduled for Sunday, which means I can\u2019t work on it until then. So Taskwarrior\nhelpfully hides it from me, eliminating a source of noise in my TODO list. This\nis absolutely vital to the way that I approach task management! It\u2019s what allows\nme to achieve Inbox Zero with my tasks. I like this workflow so much, I\u2019ve even added a count of tasks that are ready\nfor work (by parsing the output of task ready) to my command-line prompt. This\nmotivates me to take care of my TODO list as soon as possible, the same way\nthat my email inbox\u2019s unread message count motivates me to tend to my email.

In such cases, Apple has been removing the application in question and informing developers that their app violates two parts of the App Store Review Guidelines\u2026 \n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n Thus far, we\u2019ve seen several cases of Apple cracking down on these types of applications. The company informs developers via email that \u201cupon re-evaluation,\u201d their application is in violation of sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2 of the App Store Review Guidelines, which pertain to transmitting user location data and user awareness of data collection. Legal \u2013 5.1.1 and Legal 5.1.2 The app transmits user location data to third parties without explicit consent from the user and for unapproved purposes. Apple explains that developers must remove any code, frameworks, or SDKs that relate to the violation before their app can be resubmitted to the App Store. Apple\u2019s crackdown on these applications comes amid a growing industry shift due to General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, in the European Union. While Apple has always been a privacy-focused company, it is seemingly looking to ensure that developers take the same care of user data. In the instances we\u2019ve seen, the apps in question don\u2019t do enough to inform users about what happens with their data. In addition to simply asking for permission, Apple appears to want developers to explain what the data is used for and how it is shared. Furthermore, the company is cracking down on instances where the data is used for purposes unrelated to improving the user experience: You may not use or transmit someone\u2019s personal data without first obtaining their permission and providing access to information about how and where the data will be used. Data collected from apps may not be used or shared with third parties for purposes unrelated to improving the user experience or software\/hardware performance connected to the app\u2019s functionality. At this point, it\u2019s unclear how broad this cleansing effort is for the App Store. We\u2019ve seen at least one public tweet mentioning the program, while several other developers have mentioned it privately.

ESA\/Gaia\/DPAC Senior Writer May 8, 2018 On April 25, Teresa Antoja of the University of Barcelona was one of thousands of astronomers who downloaded and began exploring an exquisite new map of the Milky Way made by the European Space Agency\u2019s Gaia spacecraft. Within a day, she and her colleagues reported the discovery of never-before-seen substructures throughout the galaxy: \u201cshapes such as arches \u2026 snail shells and ridges,\u201d they wrote \u2014 each one a clue about the Milky Way\u2019s obscure past. Antoja\u2019s paper is one of a torrent following the long-awaited second data release from Gaia, which was launched in 2013 and has since charted the positions, brightnesses and colors of 1.7 billion Milky Way stars, and the velocities of 1.3 billion of those stars. (In September 2016, the Gaia team released its first map with only position and brightness measurements for 1.1 billion stars.) Astronomers, who had previously catalogued just 2.5 million of the brightest stars in the galaxy, are hailing a new era of precision astronomy. These are some of the most important discoveries to come from the Gaia data so far. A team in France applied their preprepared STREAMFINDER algorithm to the Gaia data and immediately uncovered a rich network of \u201cstellar streams,\u201d or tributaries of stars flowing into and around the Milky Way. \u201cThe idea is to trace the streams backward in time along their orbits in order to contemplate the galaxy\u2019s past and its formation history,\u201d said Khyati Malhan of the University of Strasbourg, lead author of the paper detailing these \u201cgalactic archaeology\u201d findings, in an email. The profusion of stellar streams \u2014 believed to be remnants of small satellite galaxies and star clusters that were drawn in by gravity \u2014 could potentially resolve the \u201cmissing satellite problem,\u201d which asks why only 50-odd satellite galaxies currently orbit the Milky Way, despite hundreds arising in computer simulations of galaxy formation. Another mystery is why the Milky Way\u2019s satellites lie in a plane, even though simulations suggest they should have formed all around. Malhan and colleagues hope to either sharpen or resolve this plane-of-satellite problem via \u201cstatistical analysis of structure and dynamics of a large sample of streams,\u201d he said.

Courtesy of Khyati Malhan Another group used the Gaia data to do a detailed study of the galaxy\u2019s longest stellar stream. Some of its stars appear to have been perturbed by patches of invisible dark matter, suggesting the streams can be used to map dark matter substructure throughout the galaxy. For decades, astrophysicists have debated the origin of Type Ia supernovas \u2014 star explosions that serve as \u201cstandard candles\u201d for gauging cosmic distances. Using the Gaia data and follow-up telescope observations, Ken Shen of the University of California, Berkeley, and collaborators found strong evidence for a theory dubbed the \u201cdynamically driven double-degenerate double-detonation\u201d (D6) scenario. The D6 scenario begins with two white dwarfs \u2014 dense, planet-size cores of dead stars \u2014 in a close mutual orbit. According to the theory, the heavier white dwarf will suddenly start stripping matter away from the lighter one, so rapidly and turbulently that some of the helium in the transferred matter detonates. This detonation triggers the detonation of carbon and oxygen in the heavier dwarf, causing it to explode as a Type Ia supernova. With nothing holding on to it anymore, the other white dwarf is flung into space at high speed. Among the Gaia data, Shen and colleagues discovered three \u201chypervelocity white dwarfs\u201d hurtling through the galaxy at more than 1,000 kilometers per second, which is fast enough to escape its gravity. They claim the discoveries represent \u201ctentative confirmation\u201d of the D6 scenario. In an email, Shen said knowing the backstory of Type Ia supernovas will reduce uncertainties in cosmic distance measurements and models of supernova-driven chemical enrichment of galaxies. U.K. astronomers traced the origin of another hypervelocity star to the center of the Large Magellanic Cloud, the Milky Way\u2019s largest satellite galaxy. It could mean only one thing: that the star was accelerated by whipping around a massive black hole at the center of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Full-size galaxies almost always harbor huge central black holes, which are of mysterious provenance. Their presence in some mini galaxies compounds the mystery. Stars rotating clockwise around the center of the Large Magellan Cloud, the Milky Way\u2019s biggest satellite galaxy. ESA\/Gaia\/DPAC In 1998, Adam Riess and other astronomers inferred, based on the distances to Type Ia supernovas, that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, driven by \u201cdark energy.\u201d As for how fast space is currently expanding (a rate known as the \u201cHubble constant\u201d), curiously, the supernova-based estimates differ by about 8 percent from estimates based on light from the early universe, even after accounting for the dark-energy-driven acceleration that has happened since then. It\u2019s one of the biggest puzzles in cosmology. Now, Riess and collaborators have used Gaia data to more precisely measure distances to Cepheid stars, which in turn calibrate distances to Type Ia supernovas. This allowed them to make the most precise supernova-based measurement yet of the Hubble constant, which has only worsened the discrepancy with early-universe observations. While many researchers are studying the diverse populations and dynamics of stars within the galaxy proper, Laura Watkins of the Space Telescope Science Institute and colleagues used motions of star clusters orbiting the Milky Way to gauge the galaxy\u2019s mass. Including its dark matter, they say, it weighs roughly 1.5 trillion solar masses. And Joshua Simon of the Carnegie Institution for Science analyzed a distant population of satellite galaxies, finding that all of them are currently at the closest points in their orbits around the Milky Way. This seeming coincidence is \u201cstrange,\u201d Simon said by email. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had enough time to figure out the implications of this result yet.\u201d \u201cWe knew Gaia would be revolutionary,\u201d Simon said. Astronomers will be picking its fruits for years.

Americas+1 212 318 2000 EMEA+44 20 7330 7500 Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000 Qualcomm Inc., the biggest maker of mobile-phone chips, is preparing to give up its push to develop processors for data-center servers, an effort that sought to break Intel Corp.\u2019s hold on the lucrative market, according to a person familiar with the company\u2019s plans. The San Diego-based company is exploring whether to shutter the unit or look for a new owner for the division, which was working on ways to get technology from ARM Holdings Plc into the market for chips that are at the heart of servers, the person said. ARM is one of Intel\u2019s only rivals in developing semiconductor designs, and its architecture is primarily used in less power-intensive products, such as smartphones. Qualcomm is the largest backer of an effort to find a role for ARM designs in the highest end of the computing market, where individual chips sell for multiple thousands of dollars. Chipmakers have been trying for years to provide owners of large data centers \u2013 companies such as Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s Amazon Web Services \u2013 with processors to run them, trying to break into a business that Intel dominates with about 99 percent market share. A Qualcomm spokesman declined to comment. In the company\u2019s earnings report last month, Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf told analysts that Qualcomm is focused on spending reductions in its non-core product areas. Servers, which crunch data in corporate networks and act as the backbone of the internet, are a much smaller market than phones and personal computers when measured by shipments. But the price that chipmakers are able to charge for the high-performance parts needed to run them makes the market attractive. Qualcomm began selling a server chip, the Centriq 2400, based on ARM technology last year. At the time, the company said the chips, which were manufactured by Samsung Electronics Co., offered better results than an Intel Xeon Platinum 8180 processor, based on energy efficiency and cost. At the public introduction of the server chip line in November, potential customers such as Microsoft Corp. took to the stage to voice their interest in the offering. Since then, Qualcomm has been silent about its progress. While abandoning the effort would save Qualcomm the expense of designing some of the most expensive chips that the semiconductor industry produces, it would also be a retreat from the company\u2019s goal of becoming less dependent on the slowing market for mobile-phone parts. Qualcomm\u2019s management promised investors in January that the company would cut $1 billion in annual costs to improve profitability as part of an effort to fend off a hostile takeover bid by Broadcom Inc. Qualcomm prevailed because the U.S. government decided in March that the proposed deal posed a security risk. Investors had been on course to side with the would-be acquisition effort.","time":1525858571,"title":"Qualcomm Plans Exit From Server Chips","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-05-07\/qualcomm-is-said-to-plan-exit-from-server-chips-amid-cost-cuts","label":0,"label_name":"biz-news"},{"by":"assafmo","descendants":31,"id":17028512,"kids":"[17030114, 17030755, 17030564, 17030084, 17031095, 17031938, 17033909, 17033923, 17030630, 17030456, 17030025]","score":82,"text":"\nMay 9, 2018\n       UPDATE: Some users on HN [1] and reddit [2][3][4] pointed out that the fdisk method is outdated.

North Just over thirty years after the first printing press arrived in the New World from Spain, the first medical book was printed in Mexico City: Francisco Bravo\u2019s Opera Medicinalia, published by Pedro Ocharte in 1570. While it is well within NLM\u2019s mission to collect, preserve and give the world access to such a book, there is only one known copy of it, housed in La Biblioteca Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Lafragua at the Benem\u00e9rita Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Puebla\u00a0in Mexico and we are all extremely fortunate that this sole copy has been digitized by the Primeros Libros project. The National Library of Medicine does have a copy of the text, however, in the form of a photostatic copy made in 1944. Long before the age of digitization, the only ways to make rare texts available at other libraries were by copying them by hand, reprinting them, microfilming, or making photocopies, all of which are extremely time-consuming and expensive for entire books. This copy was made from a photostatic copy at the Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens, which in turn was made from a photostatic copy at the New York Public Library. The copy in New York is described as a \u201cfacsimile reproduction of the original at the Library at the Universidad de Puebla, Mexico\u201d where the only original copy is held. NLM has at least five other early printed books from the 1500s made using the old photostatic process from the Huntington\u2019s copies. All of these are very rare medical books printed in England between the years 1502 and 1539: some of the earliest medical books printed in England, so scarce the NLM had little chance of ever obtaining originals. Not much is known about the author of the first medical book printed in the New World, Francisco Bravo, but he was born in Southern Spain around 1525 and studied medicine at the University in Osuna or Sevilla. He was practicing medicine in Sevilla in 1553, and at some point he made the crossing to Mexico\u2014probably sometime after 1560. He practiced medicine in Mexico City and served on the university\u2019s medical faculty there. He seems to have died in about 1595. Written in Latin, Opera Medicinalia consists of a set of treatises on various medical topics including a long discourse on a disease called \u201ctabardete,\u201d which may have been typhus, citing works on the topic by earlier Arab and Greek physicians. Typhus is a disease spread by lice, and was common on board ships crossing the Atlantic during the colonial period. Also included in the book is a long treatise in the form of a dialog on bloodletting accompanied by a simplistic woodcut of the venous system inspired by Andreas Vesalius\u2019 Epistle [on Venesection], printed in Basel in 1539. Bravo also included a long discussion of the sarsaparilla plant (Smilax aspera), native to North America, including Mexico, whose roots were thought to cure a number of ailments. The book includes two woodcut illustrations of the plant by Juan Ortiz which were based upon illustrations from Pietro Mattioli\u2019s Commentaries on Dioscorides (Commentarii\u2026 De Materia Medica) published in Venice in 1554. The fact that Bravo\u2019s book was written in Latin, shows that it was aimed at a scholarly audience rather than the general public. Opera Medicinalia was printed by Pedro Ocharte (1532\u20131592), who was originally from Rouen, France and had Hispanicized his name from Pierre Ochart or Charte. He arrived in Mexico from Sevilla as a merchant in the 1550s and by 1560 was managing the press of Mexico\u2019s first printer, Juan Pablos (1500\u20131560 or 1561). Soon after Pablos died, Ocharte married his daughter Maria Figueroa and took over the press. The main body of the text was printed using one of Juan Pablos\u2019s old thick, blackletter typefaces, which was more common in Germany from which Spain\u2019s first printers came. Eventually printers in Spain preferred Roman typefaces (as in most of Southern and Western Europe), and you can see these in use in this book\u2019s printed marginalia. In 1571, a year after Ocharte printed Opera Medicinalia, he and his assistant Juan Ortiz (1538\u2013ca. 1595) were arrested by the Holy Inquisition and subjected to brutal torture for allegedly having \u201cheretical opinions;\u201d the reality was that others may have denounced them\u00a0because they were jealous of Ocharte\u2019s success and wealth and because he and Ortiz were non-Spanish (Ortiz was also born in France). Ocharte\u2019s press continued to produce books during his imprisonment, which ended in 1574, and he went on to print books until 1592. The last book he printed was also a medical book, Agust\u00edn Farfan\u2019s Tractado Brebe de Medicina. By coincidence, the former office and prison of the Holy Inquisition in Mexico City where Ocharte was held is now the Museo de Medicina Mexicana, a museum focusing on the history of medicine in Mexico.

Since its inception, Eshell has suffered from an arguably low popularity.\nSee what the community says: Hell, even the official manual gives a fair warning against its use: I\u2019m not arguing that those arguments are not valid. (To most extent, they are.) I want to argue that the issue is not so much that Eshell is not a\nproper Unix shell (in the sense of POSIX sh and derivatives), but rather\nperhaps we do not need a Unix shell and all its historical limitations. In other words: the non-Unix-ness of Eshell is more of a step forward than a\nhindrance.  Let\u2019s review the situation. Take this typical scenario: I\u2019ve got a long running process which finally\noutputs pages of relevant information.  Only then I realize that it would have\nbeen smart saving that somewhere.  Now I want to copy it to the clipboard.  How\ndo I do that? By clumsily mouse-selecting pages of terminal output, assuming my terminal can\nhandle it. Why can\u2019t I (fuzzy-)search the shell output? Why can\u2019t I browse the different prompts of my shell session? Why can\u2019t I copy\/paste without a mouse? Back in the days, VT-like terminals were our main mean of communicating with a\nmachine.  Decades went by, our desktop computers can now handle gigabytes of\nbuffering and display in 24-bit colors, and yet we still stick to terminal\nemulators, that is, programs that emulate the restrictions of those ancient\nmachines. Cannot move the cursor around. Limited colors. Terminal capabilities are neither simple nor portable.  See termcap(5). Formatting (e.g. colors) needs ugly escape codes that are not even portable. More hacks than computer science history would have ever hoped for. Say I run this command: Now I want to see what\u2019s in foo.  How do I do that? Either I mouse-select the file, hoping I\u2019ll not be off-by-one on one side.\nThen I paste to the prompt. Or I type the path myself, with a bit of luck completion will bring me there\nsoon enough. Or I resort to re-call the command from a subcommand and program some output\nmanipulation to extract the filename and then open it with my editor.  This is\nnot nearly universal nor even convenient. All this is terribly backwards and it is high time we moved on. It\u2019s important to understand that shells are not (or should not be) semantically\nbound to terminal emulator restrictions.  Shells are a textual interface to the\nmachine.  They just need input, evaluation, execution, output.\nGTK\/Qt\/Tk\/etc. are absolutely capable of handling such a task.  Not mentioning\nEmacs\u2026 So why do shells de facto need a terminal?  One thing: curses-like interfaces.\nThose libraries need terminal capabilities to render.  Do we still really need that? It\u2019s most limited in terms of user experience.  Mouse selection simply won\u2019t\ndo. It\u2019s not beautiful. It cannot render anything beside text.  (Without clumsy hacks at least.) \u201cIt works on low-end systems\u201d: there is not much hardware out there that\ncannot take Wayland or X.  Anyways, my case is about desktop computers. It\u2019s not even fast: in fact terminals can be pretty slow at rendering.\n(Emulators also emulate the baud-rate, etc.) Since it\u2019s character-based, it cannot render fonts of different sizes nor,\nsay, thin lines. \u201cEfficiency on remote systems\u201d: that\u2019s almost a fair statement.  But then\u2026\nTRAMP! ;) Back to my initial example of the long-running process: want to copy that output\nsomewhere?  3 key-strokes with Eshell.  And better: could be even 1 if you want\nto program it your way.  The interface is extensible.  (Terminals usually\naren\u2019t, URxvt and its Perl scripts are not a proud example of extensibility.) Eshell breaks up with the \u201cterminal-interface\u201d paradigm: the user interface of\nthe Eshell commandline-interface is Emacs it self.  The pager is the Emacs\nbuffer.  The input is Emacs keystrokes.  The extension language is Elisp.\nConsequences: No need for pagers like less.  You won\u2019t ever re-run a long-output command by\nappending | less to it. Little need for output ad-hoc minipulations (e.g. grep trial-and-error\nqueries\u2013grep is not a search tool): output the result to an Emacs buffer, use\nsome Lisp functions, use Evil ex commands, iedit, swiper, helm-moccur or\nmultiple-cursors\u2026 Eshell supports TRAMP!  Which means you don\u2019t have to put aside your powerful\nenvironment when switching to root or connecting to a remote host: all the power\nof your Emacs can be used anywhere, the shell included. Find file\/URL at point.  Or list them all with Ivy\/Helm and fuzzy-search them! No need for fzf.  \u201cHey! fzf is awesome!\u201d\nI know, but even fzf cannot compete with Emacs. At last, done with the clumsy Bash and sh-inspired shell languages!  No more\nnasty word-splitting, no more unexpected expansion.  You don\u2019t even need calc\nor bc when you have Elisp or Emacs\u2019 calc at hand. No need for half-implemented vi-bindings when you can have Evil to edit your\ncommand-line.  (Some shells like fish can call an editor\nto edit the commandline.  Well, with Eshell it\u2019s one step less.) You can even edit the output directly! You can redirect output to several buffers(!), they don\u2019t even need to be\nexisting files. Eshell has loads of fancy\nfeatures\nfor globbing, filtering, and editing. Programmable completion with pcomplete, which is arguably easier and yet\nmore powerful than its Bash\/Zsh\/fish counterparts. Finally, some Helm niceties: helm-find-files has M-e to switch to Eshell in the currently browsed\nfolder.  Bye-bye cd, hello fuzzy-browsing! The previous technique makes it very convenient to go up the hierarchy to some\nparent folder (C-l by default).  Seriously, bye-bye annoying little cd ... Still with helm-find-files, M-p will trigger the \u201ccd history\u201d, so you can\nfuzzy-find the history of your shell paths.  Make it persistent with\n(add-to-list 'desktop-globals-to-save 'helm-ff-history)). Use Helm as a menu for completion.  Awesome for completing big file names or\npackages! helm-find-files has C-c i (and C-u C-c i, etc.) to insert the selected\nrelative\/absolute file names at point, that is, in the commandline.  This\nsometimes proves more convenient than file completion. In terms of extensibility, it\u2019s key to understand that (as of Emacs\n26) all prompts are\nproperly identified by Emacs.  This opens the door to infinite programmability\nof the shell interface: Browse all prompts with C-c C-n\/C-c C-p. (Or simpler bindings\u2026) Copy the output of a command with one keystroke. Collect all the prompts in an Ivy\/Helm list. Use hs-minor-mode to fold the outputs. It\u2019s undeniable however that, as of Emacs 25.2, Eshell has numerous rough edges.\nQuite a few bug reports have been sent on debbugs and it\u2019s getting better. Native completion is limited considering very little effort was ever made.  The\ncommunity can help changing that.  In the meantime, I\u2019ve implemented a fallback\nto Bash\/fish completion so\nthat I can keep completing just as much as I could with Bash or fish. Need that curses-based program?  Get a (much more) powerful Emacs alternative: git (CLI), gitk, tig, etc. -> magit htop -> symon, proced, helm-top\u2026 abook -> org-contacts mutt -> mu4e, gnus ncdu -> dired-du cmus\/moc -> EMMS newsbeuter -> Elfeed, gnus weechat, irssi -> ERC, etc. rtorrent, transmission-cli -> transmission.el As opposed to their curses-like counterparts, Emacs alternatives share all those\nfeatures: Configure\/extend in Lisp. (Fuzzy-)search the buffer.  Copy anything to the clipboard. No need to change the color theme, it\u2019s already using your Emacs theme.  No\nneed for dircolors, lesspipe, Xresources\u2026 Emacs bindings (Evil?).  All configurable.  No more painful context-switch\nbetween Emacs-based and vi-based bindings. In the meantime, there might still be that annoying curses-based program you\ncannot replace.  Eshell allows you to run those programs by transparently\nswitching to a *term* buffer.  See eshell-visual-commands. Curses-based programs are not the only ones that won\u2019t run well on Eshell:\nREPL are\nknown for working poorly too.  REPLs are poorly designed though: from a\nUnix-philosophy standpoint, only the E is required for every language, while\nre-implementing the R, P, and L, i.e. the user interface, for each one of\nthem is simply re-inventing the wheel.  Instead of that, Emacs has\ncomint-mode, an REPL-lie user interface that can be plugged to any language.\nWith all the powerful features of Emacs that all those specialized REPLs are\nlacking.  For a start, you can write code in Emacs and execute any piece of code\nfrom a single keystroke. It\u2019s configurable and extensible in a consistent manner\nacross all languages. Similarly, \u201cenvironment setups\u201d, as commonly used by programming language tools\nsuch as Python\u2019s virtualenv or Ruby rvm, expect the user to be running a\nspecific shell.  This is broken by design.  Let me quote \/u\/rpdillon as I\ncould not have said better: To OP\u2019s point, though, yes, these environments do make assumptions that you\u2019ll\nbe using some kind of bash-compatible shell, which tells you a little bit\nabout how sub-optimal the state-of-the-art is. I suppose the only alternative\nI can think of is to have the language itself manage many versions of itself\nso that every developer\u2019s environment wouldn\u2019t have to be customized\/extended\nto negotiate the maze. The Go programming language for instance does not have\nsuch a tool as I know of. A long-standing critique of Eshell is that it does not support input\nredirection.  This is hardly a major hindrance since\nyou can always use a work-around such as Another common argument against Eshell is that it cannot run the widely popular\nTmux.  The latter is used for many things, out of which: Window management, tabs, etc.: you don\u2019t need that if you have Emacs. Leave long-running processes in the background after the user has logged out:\nthis feature is easily provided with nohup or dtach. All that being said, should Eshell not do the job for you, then maybe give M-x\nshell a try.  It has a similar design: it is a shell emancipated from any\nterminal; instead of being Lisp based, it runs an existing shell as an\ninterpreter.  Bash and zsh are known to work.  It has all the advantages an\nEmacs buffer has over terminal emulators.  The main difference then lies in the\nlanguage: Emacs\nLisp vs. Bash and related\nlanguages. Switching to Eshell marked a milestone for me: from then on I dropped all my\ncrufty curses-based programs and switched to much more powerful Emacs\nalternatives.  I now use Emacs everywhere to the point\nthat it even is my window manager.\nHaving a consistent environment well glued together really empowers you. Ironically, the environment is so powerful that I ended up not using any shell\nso much anymore, only for a few commands here and there.  For which I use\nEshell, obviously. Eshell might not be perfect (yet), a little beta perhaps, but this can only be\nhelped by a growing community: the more people join, the more feedback\ndevelopers get, the better it will become.  Hopefully this pamphlet will\nhelp raise your curiosity, if not more esteem for this brilliant project.","time":1525825167,"title":"Eshell as a main shell","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/ambrevar.bitbucket.io\/emacs-eshell\/","label":3,"label_name":"dev"},{"by":"CrankyBear","descendants":136,"id":17026215,"kids":"[17028077, 17027560, 17028617, 17027999, 17029308, 17029243, 17029124, 17027852, 17029230, 17030347, 17027813, 17029740, 17029846, 17027880, 17030605, 17028302, 17028973, 17029177, 17030127, 17030026, 17029706, 17027927]","score":146,"text":"DXC Blogs If I told you about a software architecture in which components of an application provided services to other components via a communications protocol over a network you would say it was\u2026 Well, it depends. If you got your start programming in the 90s, you\u2019d say I just defined a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). But, if you\u2019re younger and cut your developer teeth on the cloud, you\u2019d say: \u201cOh, you\u2019re talking about microservices.\u201d You\u2019d both be right. To really understand the differences, you need to dive deeper into these architectures. In SOA, a service is a function, which is well-defined, self-contained, and doesn\u2019t depend on the context or state of other services. There are two kinds of services. A service consumer, which requests a service from the other type, a service provider. An SOA service can play both roles. SOA services can trade data with each other. Two or more services can also coordinate with each other. These services carry out basic jobs such as creating a user account, providing login functionality, or validating a payment. SOA isn\u2019t so much about modularizing an application as it is about composing an application by integrating distributed, separately-maintained and deployed components. These components run on servers. Early versions of SOA used object-oriented protocols to communicate with each other. For example, Microsoft\u2019s Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) and Object Request Brokers (ORBs) use the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) specification. Later versions used messaging services such as Java Message Service (JMS) or Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). These service connections are called Enterprise Service Buses (ESB). Over these buses, data, almost always in eXtensible Markup Language (XML) format, is transmitted and received. Microservices is an architectural style where applications are made up from loosely coupled services or modules. It lends itself to the Continuous Integration\/Continuous Deployment (CI\/CD) model of developing large, complex applications. An application is the sum of its modules. Each microservice provides an application programming interface (API) endpoint. These are connected by lightweight protocols such as REpresentational State Transfer (REST), or gRPC. Data tends to be represented by JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or Protobuf. Both architectures stand as an alternative to the older, monolithic style of architecture where applications are built as single, autonomous units. For example, in a client-server model, a typical Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP\/Python\/Perl (LAMP) server-side application would deal with HTTP requests, run sub-programs and retrieves\/updates from the underlying MySQL database. These are all tied closely together. When you change anything, you must build and deploy a new version. With SOA, you may need to change several components, but never the entire application. With microservices, though, you can make changes one service at a time. With microservices, you\u2019re working with a true decoupled architecture. Microservices are also lighter than SOA. While SOA services are deployed to servers and virtual machines (VMs), microservices are deployed in containers. The protocols are also lighter. This makes microservices more flexible than SOA. Hence, it works better with Agile shops. So what does this mean? The long and short of it is that microservices are an SOA variation for container and cloud computing. Old style SOA isn\u2019t going away, but as we continue to move applications to containers, the microservice architecture will only grow more popular. It would be great if you could add up on service orchestration \ud83d\ude42 LikeLike While the trend the past couple years has been to put microservices in containers, that was not the prior case for the 6 or so years microservices have been popular. Another distinction of microservices from SOA is that a database must be connected to by only a single service. This allows business logic close to the data to be contained. Of course microservices can be composed together to let higher level business logic play out. Having only one service writing to a DB keeps unexpected changes down, and reduces duplicate business logic.

In the past, design tools emerged on the idea of enabling designers to move quickly. By just plotting pixels, we could concentrate on design with ease. And this separation of concerns was good. It changed the process of designing and with it, design boomed. We learned how to communicate through interfaces, and it became a key role in almost any company. But time goes on and today drawing interfaces it\u2019s just not good enough. It\u2019s too far apart from implementation and reality, and it doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. Prototyping tools helped us get closer to something that\u2019s somewhat interactive, but the main problems have always remain untouched: we are still as far apart as can be from the medium we design for, and developers and designers are too disconnected. As everything else is changing, we are still using the same design methods we started using more than 20 years ago. A necessary evil, all because coding is hard, right? Well, we believe it\u2019s time for a change! The idea of designing using code it\u2019s not new. In fact its been around for decades! because somehow, we have always known that designing in the user\u2019s environment would solve so many problems, think about it: We would have shared components made by designers that behave and look as intended to, in any device and situation. Designers and developers will help and complement each other, and development will become to be more about assembling and less about crafting. (This idea was discussed with detail in this great talk by Monica Dinculescu) But of course the design process has to be visual, simple and fast. And coding has always been slow, hardly visual and not so simple. How do you make design simple, fast and visual while using code? Well, it turns out that the Web is today such an awesome platform thanks to so many amazing people that work in making it better and better. And those are only few of the things that were needed to make it possible. Hadron is a tool aimed to make designing through code visual, fast and easy by embracing the web platform. Even though you will use code, the great thing is that not only very little writing is needed to get started, but also your designs can be progressively enhanced. Meaning that you can start designing with only simple HTML and CSS, and later make your design do more by adding behaviour through other Web Components or even writing JS yourself. Hadron provides with the help needed to make everything as simple as possible: \u2714\ufe0f You can use Flex box through the alignment tool to position elements just like you have always done: \u2714\ufe0f Or use CSS Grid through the tool, to create grids easily: \u261d But Hadron wants to help you while going hand in hand with the Web Platform. Magic doesn\u2019t happen behind. And this is great because: What does this mean? For instance\u00a0\u2026 \u2714\ufe0f When using our CSS tools such as the Flexbox, Grid, Color picker, Shadows\u2026 changes will be reflected on your CSS, and you can pick what rule is going to be affected. Those tools are there to help, not hide. \u2714\ufe0f Same for creating responsive designs. You will use standard Media Queries, but with help it couldn't be any easier. \u2714\ufe0f \ufe0fHTML is also accesible through the Elements and Selection panels. You can use the latter to update the selection HTML And the best part is that while you design, you are also creating a great modern full app. In Hadron we have the concept of \u201cengines\u201d and we are starting with the \u201cPolymer 2 Engine\u201d which means that your design is a modern Progressive Web App right from the start. On top of all this, you can work offline and sync your project whenever you have accomplished something, and then publish it to a hadronapp domain such as my-project.hadronapp.com for free. There is so much more we have to tell you about Hadron, but this introduction is already getting too long. Today we are super excited to be launching Hadron Preview Release: a way to get early access to Hadron, help us polish it and shape our product roadmap. Hadron is free to use for everyone, for an unlimited period of time with no limits, because we believe in the democratization of technology and design in particular.

Answer: Their big idea started as a side project. 1905. Albert Einstein worked six days a week full-time in an office, examining patent applications. He dedicated all his remaining hours to studying and experimenting with physics. One day, the Theory Of Relativity was conceived \u2014 completely off-the-clock. 1993. Craig Newmark, employed at an investment company, started an email list in his spare time to allow him and his friends to update each other about different events in town. Eventually, the list grew so much that there wasn\u2019t enough space in people\u2019s inboxes: it was time for a website. Enter Craigslist.com. 2018. A small sideline has the potential to morph into something huge. With reliable internet access and enough devotion, a nugget of gold becomes a rainbow. Many of the world\u2019s most successful companies started as an afterthought in someone\u2019s spare hours, while the \u2018real work\u2019 chugged on in the background. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Uber, Product Hunt, Unsplash, Pinterest, GrowthHackers, Groupon, Trello, AppSumo, Etsy, Hubspot, Gmail, WeWork, Buffer\u2026 The list goes on and on. Even Apple was born in a garage, not an office. College dropouts Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak could only work on their DIY personal computers AFTER their 9\u20135 had finished. Something brewing behind the scenes can turn into your life\u2019s work. I started building products as a hobby in college.\u00a0 While working full-time as a programmer, I patched together pockets of time to water and trim my fledgling products. It wasn\u2019t until five years later that I quit my day job and went all-in. Back then in my dorm room, I could never have predicted that one of my products, JotForm, would reach\u00a03.2 million users and 100 employees\u00a0today \u2014 without receiving a single dime of outside funding. When a project first calls your name, who knows where it will take you? It may inform or enrich your core business. It may transform your core business. There once was a multiplayer game called Glitch. Glitch was not a success. In fact, it was doing so badly that its founders decided to shut it down altogether. On the cusp of despair, they contemplated the internal chat system they had been building for fun while developing the game. It was clunky, but functional. With nothing to lose, they decided to launch the chat as a product in itself. Slack was born \u2014 and it became the fastest-growing business app in history. If you\u2019ve got a side project that beckons, what\u2019s stopping you? A buzzing side project will not take anything away from your business. It will energize it. After Google launched its 20 percent rule (employees are encouraged to spend 20% of their time exploring side projects), the result was that the remaining 80% became more productive. Sometimes, they can even land you your dream job. Running a business inevitably generates pressure and anxiety. People need to be paid. You need to perform. There is pressure to succeed. Not so with your side project. It isn\u2019t keeping you afloat; if it fails, no one will drown. It\u2019s a pressure-free playing field. And pressure-free playing fields are where the magic happens. Even the giants can\u2019t resist toying with sidelines that can seem improbable. Disney is dabbling in robot creation; Tesla is starting an energy company; Amazon is getting into groceries. Ready to play? Here are a few must-knows \u2014 especially if you harbour hopes of your baby project growing into an adolescent startup, or even a grown-up business. Scratch that. You will never \u2018find\u2019 the time. Long uninterrupted hours in which you can devote yourself to your heart\u2019s content to a side project don\u2019t exist. Nor do you need them. Side projects grow in small but frequent windows that barely make a dent in your day but add up over weeks and months. Take me as an example. I didn\u2019t let full-time work stop me from improving JotForm; I\u2019d wake up everyday at 6am, answer customer questions, then head off to my \u2018real job\u2019. Everyone has leftover minutes in their day. Secure those pockets of time. Protect them in the way you protect other things that you prioritize. Don\u2019t double-book them in your diary. Put a \u2018do-not-disturb\u2019 sign on your door. At the same time, don\u2019t put too much pressure on yourself in terms of setting deadlines. This is the area of your life to be expansive, not restrictive. Kevan Lee of Buffer knows side projects march to a different beat than 9-to-5 work. They target a separate part of the brain and therefore follow their own rules. His #1 rule? Be ok with missing deadlines. Just go and hang out with your project. Make it like date night. Finding a pain point to soothe, an unmet need or an unfilled gap doesn\u2019t have to be something complex or fancy. A quick glance at \u2018The 1,000 Upvote Club\u2019 on Product Hunt shows that the most-appreciated ideas are often neither of those things. Remember the side project advocate Crew? Their story seemed like a textbook startup nightmare, until their side project, Unsplash, turned it into a dream-come-true. Their dedicated \u2018Labs\u2019 page offers \u2018tools for the creative community\u2019. It shows the company asked itself that vital question: What can we give something valuable away in order to sell something related? Your starting point? Putting yourself in your customers\u2019 shoes. What makes their journey less than smooth? What gets in the way, or what takes too much time? What is still too complicated? We\u2019re not talking about a key part of your core business. We\u2019re assuming that that\u2019s in place. We\u2019re talking about a generous extra to surprise and delight. A free gift to your customer that emerges from the independent pursuit of an idea. A project that isn\u2019t loved will face-plant quickly. That\u2019s because you\u2019ll find lots of reasons not to spend time on it (and there are always reasons). That, in turn, will make your project wilt. Droopy projects aren\u2019t fun. You will become demotivated and resentful of the time you do spend on it. In fact, side projects should always be \u201cstupid\u201d, says former Spotify designer and side project champion Tobias van Schneider: \u201cThe  only way a side project will work is if people give themselves  permission to think simple, to change their minds, to fail\u200a\u2014\u200abasically,  to not take them too seriously.  When  you treat something like it\u2019s stupid, you have fun with it, you \ndon\u2019t  put too much structure around it. You can enjoy different types \nof  success.\u201d So make it something that you\u2019re into. Because, for the time being, the enjoyment and satisfaction that you get out of your project will be your only reward. Or, as Huit Denim Co puts it: \u201cA side project is a Labor of Love. You provide the \u2018Labor\u2019. And you provide the \u2018Love\u2019.  So when you spend time on it, it is because you really want to. That keeps you coming back and pushing it on.\u201d So you\u2019ve showed up (and keep showing up). And it\u2019s fun. But it feels messy. You don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going. Some aspects feel plain wrong. That\u2019s just right for a side project. The rest of your life may be about meeting goals, targets and expectations. This part isn\u2019t. It\u2019s your time to play, tinker, try things out, and wander down paths that don\u2019t have a clear destination. Wanting to get somewhere in as little time as possible is the surest way to kill off inspiration of any kind. The best way to approach a side project is as an experiment, rather than something with a clear-cut goal. Paul Jarvis, creative entrepreneur and author of \u2018Company of One\u2019, explains: \u201cExperiments don\u2019t \u201cfail\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200athey simply prove or disprove a hypothesis. So focus on the task at hand. Not the end result.\u201d If you are a bootstrapped startup like JotForm that is profitable, you have the freedom to experiment abundantly. With no investors breathing down our neck, we can take as many fun risks as we please \u2014 and we do. It\u2019s great to dream big. But becoming hyper-focused on the results and success of your side project can end in paralysis \u2014 and bitter resentment when things don\u2019t go to plan. Because when it comes to side projects, things usually don\u2019t go to plan. That\u2019s what makes them so exciting. So go in without expectations and see what happens. Something always does. Don\u2019t be scared to invest time and effort into something that truly makes you tick. It won\u2019t distract you or tire you out; it will energize you. Worst case scenario, you sate your curiosity. Best case scenario, you discover your life\u2019s work. But either way, don\u2019t worry too much. After all, it\u2019s only a side project. \n \n      Learn from the founders behind hundreds of profitable online businesses, and connect with others who are starting and growing their own companies.\n    ","time":1525814028,"title":"How to build a startup\u200awithout quitting your day job","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/www.indiehackers.com\/@aytekin\/how-to-build-a-startup-without-quitting-your-day-job-d9d1176709","label":7,"label_name":"random"},{"by":"sandGorgon","descendants":0,"id":17024416,"kids":"None","score":3,"text":"Degrade gracefully on older versions of Android Write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code Provide support for apps with multiple DEX files An Android testing framework for unit and runtime UI tests Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements Manage your activity and fragment lifecycles Notify views when underlying database changes Handle everything needed for in-app navigation Gradually load information on demand from your data source Fluent SQLite database access Manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way Manage your Android background jobs Schedule and manage large downloads Backwards compatible API for media playback, routing and Google Cast Provides a backwards-compatible notification API with support for Wear and Auto Compatibility APIs for checking and requesting app permissions Provides a share action suitable for an app\u2019s action bar Create flexible UI elements that can display app data outside the app Move widgets and transition between screens Components to help develop apps for Android Auto.

The extension manages state, checkpoints, and restarts for you. The extension lets you define stateful workflows in a new type of function called an orchestrator function. Here are some of the advantages of orchestrator functions: Note Durable Functions is an advanced extension for Azure Functions that is not appropriate for all applications. The rest of this article assumes that you have a strong familiarity with Azure Functions concepts and the challenges involved in serverless application development. The primary use case for Durable Functions is simplifying complex, stateful coordination problems in serverless applications. The following sections describe some typical application patterns that can benefit from Durable Functions. Function chaining refers to the pattern of executing a sequence of functions in a particular order. Often the output of one function needs to be applied to the input of another function.  Durable Functions allows you to implement this pattern concisely in code. The values \"F1\", \"F2\", \"F3\", and \"F4\" are the names of other functions in the function app. Control flow is implemented using normal imperative coding constructs. That is, code executes top-down and can involve existing language control flow semantics, like conditionals, and loops.  Error handling logic can be included in try\/catch\/finally blocks. The ctx parameter (DurableOrchestrationContext) provides methods for invoking other functions by name, passing parameters, and returning function output. Each time the code calls await, the Durable Functions framework checkpoints the progress of the current function instance. If the process or VM recycles midway through the execution, the function instance resumes from the previous await call. More on this restart behavior later. Fan-out\/fan-in refers to the pattern of executing multiple functions in parallel, and then waiting for all to finish.  Often some aggregation work is done on results returned from the functions.  With normal functions, fanning out can be done by having the function send multiple messages to a queue. However, fanning back in is much more challenging. You'd have to write code to track when the queue-triggered functions end and store function outputs. The Durable Functions extension handles this pattern with relatively simple code. The fan-out work is distributed to multiple instances of function F2, and the work is tracked by using a dynamic list of tasks. The .NET Task.WhenAll API is called to wait for all of the called functions to finish. Then the F2function outputs are aggregated from the dynamic task list and passed on to the F3 function. The automatic checkpointing that happens at the await call on Task.WhenAll ensures that any crash or reboot midway through does not require a restart of any already completed tasks. The third pattern is all about the problem of coordinating the state of long-running operations with external clients. A common way to implement this pattern is by having the long-running action triggered by an HTTP call, and then redirecting the client to a status endpoint that they can poll to learn when the operation completes.  Durable Functions provides built-in APIs that simplify the code you write for interacting with long-running function executions. The samples show a simple REST command that can be used to start new orchestrator function instances. Once an instance is started, the extension exposes webhook HTTP APIs that query the orchestrator function status. The following example shows the REST commands to start an orchestrator and to query its status. For clarity, some details are omitted from the example. Because the state is managed by the Durable Functions runtime, you don't have to implement your own status tracking mechanism. Even though the Durable Functions extension has built-in webhooks for managing long-running orchestrations, you can implement this pattern yourself using your own function triggers (such as HTTP, queue, or Event Hub) and the orchestrationClient binding. For example, you could use a queue message to trigger termination.  Or you could use an HTTP trigger protected by an Azure Active Directory authentication policy instead of the built-in webhooks that use a generated key for authentication.  The DurableOrchestrationClient starter parameter is a value from the orchestrationClient output binding, which is part of the Durable Functions extension. It provides methods for starting, sending events to, terminating, and querying for new or existing orchestrator function instances. In the previous example, an HTTP triggered-function takes in a functionName value from the incoming URL and passes that value to StartNewAsync. This binding API then returns a response that contains a Location header and additional information about the instance that can later be used to look up the status of the started instance or terminate it. The monitor pattern refers to a flexible recurring process in a workflow - for example, polling until certain conditions are met. A regular timer-trigger can address a simple scenario, such as a periodic cleanup job, but its interval is static and managing instance lifetimes becomes complex. Durable Functions enables flexible recurrence intervals, task lifetime management, and the ability to create multiple monitor processes from a single orchestration. An example would be reversing the earlier async HTTP API scenario. Instead of exposing an endpoint for an external client to monitor a long-running operation, the long-running monitor consumes an external endpoint, waiting for some state change.  Using Durable Functions, multiple monitors that observe arbitrary endpoints can be created in a few lines of code. The monitors can end execution when some condition is met, or be terminated by the DurableOrchestrationClient, and their wait interval can be changed based on some condition (i.e. exponential backoff.) The following code implements a basic monitor. When a request is received, a new orchestration instance is created for that job ID. The instance polls a status until a condition is met and the loop is exited. A durable timer is used to control the polling interval. Further work can then be performed, or the orchestration can end. When the ctx.CurrentUtcDateTime exceeds the expiryTime, the monitor ends. Many processes involve some kind of human interaction. The tricky thing about involving humans in an automated process is that people are not always as highly available and responsive as cloud services. Automated processes must allow for this, and they often do so by using timeouts and compensation logic. One example of a business process that involves human interaction is an approval process. For example, approval from a manager might be required for an expense report that exceeds a certain amount. If the manager does not approve within 72 hours (maybe they went on vacation), an escalation process kicks in to get the approval from someone else (perhaps the manager's manager).  This pattern can be implemented using an orchestrator function. The orchestrator would use a durable timer to request approval and escalate in case of timeout. It would wait for an external event, which would be the notification generated by some human interaction. The durable timer is created by calling ctx.CreateTimer. The notification is received by ctx.WaitForExternalEvent. And Task.WhenAny is called to decide whether to escalate (timeout happens first) or process approval (approval is received before timeout). An external client can deliver the event notification to a waiting orchestrator function using either the built-in HTTP APIs or by using DurableOrchestrationClient.RaiseEventAsync API from another function: Behind the scenes, the Durable Functions extension is built on top of the Durable Task Framework, an open-source library on GitHub for building durable task orchestrations. Much like how Azure Functions is the serverless evolution of Azure WebJobs, Durable Functions is the serverless evolution of the Durable Task Framework. The Durable Task Framework is used heavily within Microsoft and outside as well to automate mission-critical processes. It's a natural fit for the serverless Azure Functions environment. Orchestrator functions reliably maintain their execution state using a cloud design pattern known as Event Sourcing. Instead of directly storing the current state of an orchestration, the durable extension uses an append-only store to record the full series of actions taken by the function orchestration. This has many benefits, including improving performance, scalability, and responsiveness compared to \"dumping\" the full runtime state. Other benefits include providing eventual consistency for transactional data and maintaining full audit trails and history. The audit trails themselves enable reliable compensating actions. The use of Event Sourcing by this extension is transparent. Under the covers, the await operator in an orchestrator function yields control of the orchestrator thread back to the Durable Task Framework dispatcher. The dispatcher then commits any new actions that the orchestrator function scheduled (such as calling one or more child functions or scheduling a durable timer) to storage. This transparent commit action appends to the execution history of the orchestration instance. The history is stored in a storage table. The commit action then adds messages to a queue to schedule the actual work. At this point, the orchestrator function can be unloaded from memory. Billing for it stops if you're using the Azure Functions Consumption Plan.  When there is more work to do, the function is restarted and its state is reconstructed. Once an orchestration function is given more work to do (for example, a response message is received or a durable timer expires), the orchestrator wakes up again and re-executes the entire function from the start in order to rebuild the local state. If during this replay the code tries to call a function (or do any other async work), the Durable Task Framework consults with the execution history of the current orchestration. If it finds that the activity function has already executed and yielded some result, it replays that function's result, and the orchestrator code continues running. This continues happening until the function code gets to a point where either it is finished or it has scheduled new async work. The replay behavior creates constraints on the type of code that can be written in an orchestrator function. For example, orchestrator code must be deterministic, as it will be replayed multiple times and must produce the same result each time. The complete list of constraints can be found in the Orchestrator code constraints section of the Checkpointing and restart article. Currently C# (Functions v1 and v2) and JavaScript (Functions v2 only) are the only supported languages for Durable Functions. This includes orchestrator functions and activity functions. In the future, we will add support for all languages that Azure Functions supports. See the Azure Functions GitHub repository issues list to see the latest status of our additional language support work. The Durable Functions extension automatically emits structured tracking data to Application Insights when the function app is configured with an Application Insights instrumentation key. This tracking data can be used to monitor the behavior and progress of your orchestrations. Here is an example of what the Durable Functions tracking events look like in the Application Insights portal using Application Insights Analytics:  There is a lot of useful structured data packed into the customDimensions field in each log entry. Here is an example of one such entry fully expanded.  Because of the replay behavior of the Durable Task Framework dispatcher, you can expect to see redundant log entries for replayed actions. This can be useful to understand the replay behavior of the core engine. The Diagnostics article shows sample queries that filter out replay logs so you can see just the \"real-time\" logs. The Durable Functions extension uses Azure Storage queues, tables, and blobs to persist execution history state and trigger function execution. The default storage account for the function app can be used, or you can configure a separate storage account. You might want a separate account due to storage throughput limits. The orchestrator code you write does not need to (and should not) interact with the entities in these storage accounts. The entities are managed directly by the Durable Task Framework as an implementation detail. Orchestrator functions schedule activity functions and receive their responses via internal queue messages. When a function app runs in the Azure Functions Consumption plan, these queues are monitored by the Azure Functions Scale Controller and new compute instances are added as needed. When scaled out to multiple VMs, an orchestrator function may run on one VM while activity functions it calls run on several different VMs. You can find more details on the scale behavior of Durable Functions in Performance and scale. Table storage is used to store the execution history for orchestrator accounts. Whenever an instance rehydrates on a particular VM, it fetches its execution history from table storage so that it can rebuild its local state. One of the convenient things about having the history available in Table storage is that you can take a look and see the history of your orchestrations using tools such as Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer.  Warning While it's easy and convenient to see execution history in table storage, avoid taking any dependency on this table. It may change as the Durable Functions extension evolves. All known issues should be tracked in the GitHub issues list. If you run into a problem and can't find the issue in GitHub, open a new issue and include a detailed description of the problem.

Google is launching the public beta for Android P today, which you\u2019ll be able to sign up for at this link. And in a nice twist, the beta is open to more than just Google-made phones this year: you\u2019ll be able to get it on the Essential Phone, Oppo\u2019s R15 Pro, Nokia\u2019s 7 Plus, Sony\u2019s Xperia XZ2, Xiaomi\u2019s Mi Mix 2S, Vivo\u2019s X21, the still-unreleased OnePlus 6, and of course the Pixel and Pixel 2. Depending on what phone you have, you\u2019ll have to take different steps to get started with the beta; it\u2019ll be easiest on a Pixel, which just lets you download it through the existing software update feature. The downside of testing is \u2014 and this is a big warning \u2014 once you\u2019re in the beta program, there\u2019s no going back. Not easily, at least: you\u2019ll have to wipe your phone if you want to opt out and return to stable releases of Android Oreo. Keep in mind that you\u2019re likely to encounter some bugs and probably shouldn\u2019t try this on the phone you use daily. \n    Related\n   Android P includes some major new features that ought to make your phone a little bit less stressful to use. The update allows you to set time limits on apps, switch your phone to grayscale at night, and easily hide all notifications when you\u2019re on vacation, going to bed, or just don\u2019t want to see them.

This enables developers with Hyper-V enabled on their machines to use a hardware accelerated Android emulator, without needing to switch to Intel\u2019s HAXM hypervisor. Amazing work was done by the Windows Hyper-V team, with help from the Xamarin team, to make to this happen. Today\u2019s preview means you can use Google\u2019s Android emulator side-by-side with other Hyper-V based technologies, including Hyper-V VMs, Docker tooling, the HoloLens emulator, and more. This means that any Android developer on Windows, who also uses Hyper-V, can use a fast Android emulator that will always support the latest Android APIs, works with Google Play Services out of the box, and works with all features in the Android emulator, including camera, geolocation, and Quick Boot. The Windows Hypervisor Platform was introduced in the Windows 10 April 2018 Update and enables third-party virtualization stacks to utilize the Windows Hypervisor for hardware acceleration. If you are using Hyper-V, this stack replaces Intel HAXM as the hypervisor for the Android emulator. Support for using the Windows Hypervisor as an accelerator for the Android emulator is currently in preview and requires the Windows 10 April 2018 Update. Here are the steps to get it installed. Open Turn Windows features on or off and select Hyper-V and the Windows Hypervisor Platform checkboxes. For these features to take effect, you will need to restart your machine.  To enable IDE support for the Android emulator, such as debugging, you must install an updated preview of the Visual Studio Tools for Xamarin. First, ensure you have Visual Studio 2017 version 15.8 Preview 1 or higher with the Mobile development with .NET (Xamarin) workload installed. Download and open the preview installer. Click Install. In Visual Studio, select Tools > Options > Android > Android SDK Manager. Click the Tools tab, select the Android Emulator component, and select Apply Changes.  Now when you debug your Android apps, you can use the latest Android SDKs in a fast emulator, right from Visual Studio alongside Hyper-V based technologies like Docker. We need your help to make using the Google Android emulator with Hyper-V an amazing experience. Be sure to share your feedback in Visual Studio by going to Help > Send Feedback > Report a Problem if you experience any problems or strange behavior.

This sounds like the answer to the problem I have been having here:\nhttps:\/\/forums.xamarin.com\/discussion\/121476\/android-application-does-not-deploy-to-emulator Cool !!! Feature have been waited for long time Does it also work in Windows Server 2016 and beyond? Hi! I work as a PM on the Visual Studio Tools for Xamarin team. This release just supports Windows 10, but we are investigating supporting Windows Server scenarios as well. It is a very interesting scenario, because in many companies the programmers work against virtual machines and not with their own computers. These virtual machines run on hosts with Windows Server 2016 with nested virtualization enabled. Thanks! Thanks for the feedback, Suriman2! I\u2019m a PM on the Hyper-V team, and my team is always looking for ways we can improve the Windows Hypervisor Platform. Then give us nested virtualization on AMD \u2013 I run 64 core EPYC servers and have no nested virtualization, People run Threadri\u00fcppper CPU\u2019s as workstation. No ntexted virtualization. Noted Thomas. Thanks for the feedback! Thank you, this is so awaited! I dont get it. Xamarin gave up on its Android emulator but now emulator it\u2019s back?\nWhy there\u2019s nothing mentioned about this? Looks to me like google moved their Emulator to Hyper-V from the intel specific setup they had. Yes, and they did it the right way this time. This also opens doors to open virtualization hosts. does this also Support the \u201cwarm\/quick boot\u201d of the Emulator? I never got this working with the normal Emulator even if I select it the Emulator always does a col boot, is slow to start and so deployment fails. Hi Andre, I work as a PM on the Visual Studio Tools for Xamarin team at Microsoft. Support for Hyper-V was added to the Google Android emulator, so everything you know and love from that experience also works on Hyper-V, such as quick boot, camera, and location simulation. The emulator will need to do an initial cold boot, but after that the quick boot snapshots should function properly. For more information, check out this blog post on quick boot:\nhttps:\/\/blog.xamarin.com\/android-emulator-quick-boot\/ Thanks,\nPierce Boggan Nice!

Newly created device with Visual Studio`s Android Device Manager also in this folder with custom name. Hi Eugins,  As I listed below, I have 4 set of AVDs. My issue is around deployment as I see \u201ckernel-ranchu-64\u201d file instead of \u201ckernel-ranchu\u201d in the folder C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Android\\android-sdk\\system-images\\android-27\\google_apis\\x86. I tried uninstalling and installing API 27, platform and play store too. Nothing changed. I have listed my console output in response to Pierce Boggan above.\nAny thoughts? Thanks, P.S. \u2013 reply option wasn\u2019t enabled to your note below. that\u2019s why reply to your comment here Hi. That\u2019s strange, in my folder C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Android\\android-sdk\\system-images\\android-27\\google_apis\\x86 I also have only kernel-ranchu-64 and android emulator on API 27 running with no errors. From your response to Pierce Boggan in output I see line \u201cemulator:Android emulator version 26.0.3.0 (build_id 3965150)\u201d but Windows Hypervisor Platform works only on Android emulator version 27.2.7 and above (step 3 in instruction) so your error may come from this. Btw, if you used Android Studio there are another folder with same Android SDK here \u201cC:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk\u201d. For me, emulator from this folder have older version with no hyper-v support and Visual Studio\u2019s Android emulator use Android folder from Program Files (with updated 27.2.7 version). Hi Eugnis, I still don\u2019t see an option to respond to your comment below, so is this place my input again. I have followed all 3 steps carefully multiple times and still getting emulator version in the output console as 26.0.3.0. Please note in the android sdk manager -my Android Emulator is showing as 27.2.7 287 MB installed; and Android SDK Platform-Tools as version 27.0.1 4MB installed. I am not sure if there is any other configuration outside of above steps that I need to modify \/ look into. I am waiting for someone from Xamarin team to respond. Clock is ticking ticking ticking \u2026. Add \u201cWindowsHypervisorPlatform = on\u201d to ~\/.android\/advancedFeatures.ini (aka C:\\Users<your-username.android\\advancedFeatures.ini) (create this file if it doesn't exist already) add advancedFeatures.ini\nstart oreo in 7s Is there a way to install the Android Emulator standalone without visual studio and the tools for Xamarin? My team develops Android apps using Android Studio, but we use Hyper-V because of Docker for Windows. We used to use the old \u201cVisual Studio Android Emulator\u201d but that was very buggy and doesn\u2019t have any system images after android 6, so we\u2019re stuck developing with physical devices over USB cables all the time. I really don\u2019t want to have to get everyone to install the entire huge Visual Studio 2017 15.8 preview update with the entire Xamarin toolset and stack (representing tens of GB) that will never get used, when we only need the emulator. Please make this a supported option Hi, Orion. I work as a PM on the Visual Studio Tools for Xamarin team. Yes! It is possible. You will need to update your Android Emulator component in the Android SDK to 27.2.7 or above. Please note that this Android emulator component is currently only available in the Android SDK canary (preview) builds. To start the emulator, you will need to follow the instructions above (Except Step #2), and \u201cWindowsHypervisorPlatform = on\u201d to your %homepath%\/.android\/advancedfeatures.ini file. You may have to create this file if it does not exist already, as other comments have noted. I keep having this error: Launching the Android Emulator hyper-v on Hyper-V needs the Windows Hypervisor Platform installed and enabled. Hi, sorry about the failure. First, please ensure that you\u2019ve enabled both \u201cHyper-V\u201d and \u201cWindows Hypervisor Platform\u201d in \u201cTurn Windows features on or off\u201d. Also, you\u2019ll need to enable an emulator feature flag for it to take effect: Add \u201cWindowsHypervisorPlatform = on\u201d to ~\/.android\/advancedFeatures.ini (aka C:\\Users<your-username\\.android\\advancedFeatures.ini) (create this file if it doesn't exist already) In upcoming emulator versions starting 27.3.1 canary, we will have this flag on by default for Intel CPUs, then in future canaries, will enable for AMD CPUs as well. Still not working unfortunately.\nWhen trying to star the debug session from the VS\u2019s Android Device Manager directly, I get this error:\nemulator: ERROR: x86 emulation currently requires hardware acceleration!\nPlease ensure Windows Hypervisor Platform (WHPX) is properly installed and usable.\nCPU acceleration status: Please disable Hyper-V before using the Android Emulator.  Start a command prompt as Administrator, run \u2018bcdedit \/set hypervisorlaunchtype off\u2019, reboot. I tested it in both the preview 15.8 Preview VS as well as the 15.7 VS.\nThe emulator that I created for testing has a API27 x86 config I am not sure if it worth mentioning or not, you need to put \u201cWindowsHypervisorPlatform=on\u201d (without the quotes) in advancedFeatures.ini at %homepath%\/.android . The only profiles available are for API 23 and lower. How to create a profile for the latest API? This is not the (old) Visual Studio Emulator for Android. It is a modified Android emulator. It supports all the images that Android SDK supports.\nInstall an image you want through Android SDK installer and then create a guest based on that image as you\u2019d normally do with Android emulator. Hi Miha, I am facing error in deployment of the app to the new emulator. My error logs are listed in the comments above.\nAfter this error, I have uninstalled and reinstalled mobile development with .net in VS stable and preview installs. Nothing helped so far. Any thought on this error ? Should the emulator be invoked from %homepath%\\.android\\tools folder the one from %homepath%\\.android\\emulator folder? 2>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Android\\android-sdk\\tools\\emulator.EXE -partition-size 512 -no-boot-anim -verbose -feature WindowsHypervisorPlatform -avd Pixel_2_XL_API_27 -prop monodroid.avdname=Pixel_2_XL_API_27\n2>PANIC: Missing emulator engine program for \u2018x86\u2019 CPU.emulator:Android emulator version 26.0.3.0 (build_id 3965150) Your thoughts will be appreciated.   Thanks Do I still have to restart my machine every time Hyper-v is enabled\/disabled?\nWith Intel HAXM\/Virtual Box\/VMware it\u2019s not required.\nI also what to have multiple hypervisors installed on my machine and be able to run them without restarts as I do with the rest. There is no need to toggle Hyper-V anymore. This works on top of Hyper-V. No need for HAXM as well. I can\u2019t even tell you how much of a relief this is! \ud83c\udf89 Hi @jnm2, are you successful in configuring and running the android emulator in your VS 15.8.1 environment? Thanks,\nNilesh How to launch emulator without Visual Studio debugging? Didn\u2019t try this release yet, but it\u2019s just (modified) Android Emulator. Find it\u2019s exe and run it, or use Android Studio. I updated Windows, installed Windows Hypervisor Platform, updated VS, added the advancedFeatures.ini file, but when I start VS2017 15.8.0 Preview 1.1 and there the Android SDK Manager, I only get the Android Emulator 27.1.12 and no option to update. Is it a problem when I also have VS2017 15.7.1 and VS2015 installed? Have you done step \u201c2. Install the Visual Studio Tools for Xamarin preview\u201d? You say that the \u201cVisual Studio Tools for Xamarin preview\u201d is something else than the Visual Studio preview including Xamarin? Well, I\u2019ll try that tomorrow. Thanks! Hi Michael! I work as a PM on the Visual Studio Tools for Xamarin team. Visual Studio tooling for the Hyper-V based Android emulator is currently available as a web preview that can be installed on top of your Visual Studio 2017 version 15.8 Preview. We are working to make sure this functionality is included in the box [and not as a web preview] in a future Visual Studio 2017 version 15.8 preview. Great news as I\u2019m keen to play with Docker but need to develop for Android.

The vision was one single security key to work across any number of services, with great user experience, security, and privacy.  On this anniversary, Yubico has taken another major leap forward toward this vision with the announcement that the recently-launched Security Key by Yubico, with FIDO2, will be supported in Windows 10 devices and Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). The feature is currently in limited preview for Microsoft Technology Adoption Program (TAP) customers.  FIDO2 is the passwordless evolution of the FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) standard, created by Yubico and Google. While U2F included a username and password, FIDO2 supports more use cases, including passwordless authentication. Yubico has worked in close collaboration with Microsoft on developing the FIDO2 technical specifications, and the Security Key by Yubico is the first FIDO2 authentication device on the market. What Does This Mean?  Organizations will soon have the option to enable employees and customers to sign in to an Azure AD joined device with no password, by simply using a Security Key to get single sign-on to all Azure AD based applications and services. This is just the beginning; Google and Mozilla also announced Chrome and Firefox support for the Web Authentication API (WebAuthn) developed by Yubico and members of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and included in the FIDO2 specification. \n  Why Is This Important?  Nearly every digital experience today requires passwords, an increasingly frustrating fact of life for businesses and users. For any one person there can be hundreds of sites and devices \u2014 both personal and business related \u2014 that require memorized passwords. This leads to poor password hygiene: shared and reused passwords. And it is a real cost for businesses managing, storing and resetting passwords for employees and end-users.  Working in conjunction with Windows and Microsoft cloud services, the new Security Key by Yubico offers a secure, seamless and passwordless login experience with one of the world\u2019s largest computer operating systems. Use cases include retail, healthcare, transportation, finance, manufacturing, and more.  How Does It Work?  FIDO2 is built on the same security and privacy features of FIDO U2F: strong public key cryptography, no drivers or client software and one key for unlimited account access with no shared secrets. With FIDO U2F, the user entered a username and password, inserted a \u00a0security key in the USB-port, and touched the gold area. FIDO2 adds more options to the login process:  Who Can Get Involved? Everyone is encouraged to get involved, and accelerate progress to a secure and passwordless world. As with any open standard, advancement will be a collective industry effort and a process of global adoption. Yubico helped the majority of services in making support for FIDO U2F by providing open source code and support. Together with W3C and FIDO Alliance we have made the FIDO2 open authentication standard available, and we are helping support its rapid integration into services and applications through our new Yubico Developer Program. Enterprises \u2192 Learn about using FIDO2 with Windows 10 devices and Microsoft Azure Active Directory in your enterprise environment. Explore the benefits of FIDO2.  Developers \u2192 Implement early support for FIDO2 by signing up for updates from Yubico\u2019s Developer Program. Members will have first access to resources to implement FIDO2 within their applications and services.  Individuals \u2192 Are you tired of passwords? If you had a choice to securely and easily login to any device or online service without them, would you? Ask for it!

The microservice API platform for large organizations. Kong Enterprise innovation delivered at cloud speed. Compare Kong editions and features. By Marco Palladino on May 8, 2018 \n\nHow To |             \n 4 \n\t\t MIN READ\n           Today we are excited to announce the\u00a0Kubernetes Ingress Controller\u00a0for Kong. Container orchestration is rapidly changing to meet the needs of software infrastructure that demands more reliability, flexibility, and efficiency than ever. At the forefront of these tools is Kubernetes, a container orchestrator that enables operations and applications teams to deploy and scale workloads that meet these needs while still enabling developers with self-service and a great developer experience. Critical to these workloads, however, is a networking stack that can support highly dynamic deployments across a clustered container orchestrator at scale. Kong is a high performance, open source API gateway, traffic control, and microservice management layer that supports the demanding networking requirements these workloads have. Kong, however, does not force teams into a one-size-fits-all solution. To serve traffic for a deep ecosystem of software and enterprises, Kong comes supplied with a rich plugin ecosystem that extends Kong with features for authentication, traffic control, and more. Deploying Kong onto Kubernetes has always been an easy process, but integration of services on Kubernetes with Kong was a manual process. That\u2019s why we are excited to announce the Kong Ingress Controller for Kubernetes. By integrating with the Kubernetes Ingress Controller spec, Kong ties directly to the Kubernetes lifecycle. As applications are deployed and new services are created, Kong will automatically live configure itself to serve traffic to these services.  This follows the Kubernetes philosophy of using declarative resources to define what we want to happen, rather than the historical imperative model of configuring servers how we want with a series of steps. In short, we define the end state. The ingress controller and Kubernetes advances the cluster to that state, rather than the end state being a side effect of actions we perform on the cluster. This automatic configuration can be costly when using load balancers that require a restart, reload, or significant time to update routes. This is the case with the open source nginx ingress controller, which is based on a configuration file that must be reloaded with every change. In a highly available, dynamic environment, this configuration reload can result in downtime or unavailable routes while nginx is being reconfigured. The open source edition of Kong and the Kong Ingress Controller has a full management layer and API, live configuration of targets and upstreams, and a durable, scalable state storage using either Postgres or Cassandra that ensures every Kong instance is synced without delay or downtime. Next, we\u2019ll show you how easy it is to set up the Kong ingress controller. We have a GitHub example and will walk you through the steps below. You can also follow Kong CTO and Co-Founder, Marco Palladino, through the setup steps in this demo presentation.  \u00a0 Getting started is just a matter of installing all of the required Kubernetes manifests, such as the ingress controller Deployment itself, a fronting service, and all of the RBAC components needed for Kong to access the Kubernetes API paths it needs to successfully work. These manifests will work on any Kubernetes cluster. If you are just getting started, we recommend using minikube for development. Minikube is an officially-provided single node Kubernetes cluster that runs on a virtual machine on your computer, and is the easiest way to get started working with Kubernetes as an application developer. Installation is as simple as running the following command: After installing the Kong Ingress Controller, we can now begin deploying services and ingress resources so that Kong can begin serving traffic to our cluster resources. Let\u2019s deploy a test service into our cluster that will serve headers and basic information about our pod back to us. This deploys our application, but we still need an Ingress Resource to serve traffic to it. We can create one for our dummy application with the following manifest: With our Kong Ingress Controller and our application deployed, we can now start serving traffic to our application. Plugins in the Kong Ingress Controller are exposed as Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). CRDs are third party API objects on the Kubernetes API server that operators can define, allowing for arbitrary data to be used in custom control loops such as the Kong Ingress Controller. Let\u2019s add the rate limiting plugin to our Kong example, and tie it to our ingress resource. Plugins map one-to-one with ingress resources, allowing us to have fine grained control over how we apply plugins to our upstreams. Now that this is applied, we can cURL our service endpoint again and get the following response: We immediately see that our rate limiting headers are applied and available for this endpoint! If we deploy another service and ingress, our rate limit plugin will not apply unless we create a new KongPlugin resource with its own configuration and add the annotation to our new ingress. Now we have a fully featured API gateway ingress stack, complete with an application and rate limiting for it. You\u2019re ready to take control of your microservices with Kong!

As the promise of workers\u0092 revolution was being dashed by the rise of fascism in Germany and the rise of Stalinism in the Soviet Union, the workers of Spain led a heroic fight against the 1936 uprising of General Francisco Franco. In the process, they led not only a struggle against fascism, but also a workers\u0092 rebellion that gave the world an inspiring glimpse of what workers\u0092 power could look like.\nThe Spanish Civil War was also the high point of anarchist influence in the international workers\u0092 movement. On the eve of the civil war, the anarchosyndicalist Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) claimed more than a million members and had as its stated aim the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism. Yet the Spanish anarchist movement failed the test that supposedly formed the heart of its program: the destruction of the state. \nThe ideas and theories of revolutionaries must ultimately be tested by events. During the war, anarchism\u0092s ideological abhorrence of state power\u0096whether that state was a capitalist or a workers\u0092 state\u0096led them, in practice, away from the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism and toward collaboration with the very government they opposed. As Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky wrote at the time, \"In opposing the goal, the conquest of power, the Anarchists could not in the end fail to oppose the means, the revolution.\"1\nAnarchism and the rise of the Spanish working class\nSpain entered the 20th century as one of the most backward countries in Europe. An aged, decrepit monarchy ruled the country, propped up by the twin pillars of the Catholic church and an aristocratic officer corps. Throughout the 19th century, peasant rebellions and military coups had broken out regularly, but none had shaken the hold of the aristocracy. The Spanish bourgeoisie, from its inception, was incapable of leading a determined struggle against the monarchy.  As Trotsky wrote:\nNow even less than in the 19th century can the Spanish bourgeoisie lay claim to that historic role which the British and French bourgeoisie once played. Appearing too late, dependent on foreign capital, the big industrial bourgeoisie of Spain, which has dug like a leech into the body of the people, is incapable of coming forward as the leader of the people, is incapable of coming forward as the leader of the \"nation\" against the old estates, even for a brief period. The magnates of Spanish industry face the people hostilely, forming a most reactionary bloc of bankers, industrialists, large landowners, the monarchy, and its generals and officials, all devouring each other in internal antagonisms.2\nLacking reliable support from the propertied classes, the monarchy turned time and again to the military. The succession of juntas and palace coups that dotted Spanish history was but an expression of the inability of the Spanish bourgeoisie to lead the struggle for even the most basic democratic rights.\nBut a new class was emerging in Spain that began to change this equation. Spain experienced a period of rapid industrialization during the First World War that led to the growth of a powerful and highly concentrated urban working class. Although Spain remained a predominantly rural country, the working class doubled in size between 1910 and 1930. \"The question of whether the present revolutionary convulsions can produce a genuine revolution, capable of reconstructing the very basis of national life,\" Trotsky continued, \"is consequently reduced to whether the Spanish proletariat is capable of taking the leadership of national life into its own hands.\"3\nAnarchism took hold in Spain beginning in the late 19th century among middle-class republican students and professionals who were distrustful of the powerful and corrupt central government; artisan workers who were being displaced by more modern production methods; and southern peasants who had a strong tradition of communalism and a distrust of both government and urban society.4 By the turn of the last century, hundreds of anarchist affinity groups\u0096small groups of 10 to 12 people with similar political ideas\u0096dotted the countryside.\nPolitically these groups covered a wide spectrum. Some groups sought to escape from the existing capitalist system by forming alternative lifestyle communes in the countryside. Some adopted an emphasis on action as a form of propaganda meant to spark wider revolt\u0096\"propaganda of the deed,\" as it was called. This could mean anything from individual acts of terrorism to organizing small, local insurrections. The purpose of these actions was to offer \"a sort of revolutionary \u0091education\u0092 of the masses through acts of revolt.\"5 And still others helped to form militant trade unions, particularly among the peasants of Andalusia and later Arag\u00f3n.\nSpanish anarchism emerged as an awkward combination of peasant communalism, petty-bourgeois individualism, direct action against the state, and radical trade unionism. Yet they shared in common the basic principles of anarchism: opposition to elections and parliamentary activity, and opposition to all forms of hierarchy and centralism.\nMany workers, even at the time of the civil war, were at most one generation removed from the countryside. These young workers brought with them a peasant anarchist tradition, and the grueling work and living conditions of urban life proved a fertile ground for the growth of a radical labor movement. \nIndividualist and terrorist currents remained part of the Spanish anarchist movement. As late as 1936, the CNT devoted an entire discussion at its national congress to the place of vegetarians, nudists, naturists, and \"opponents of industrial technology\" in a libertarian communist society. But the growing ferment among Spanish workers greatly strengthened the position of the anarchosyndicalists, who, like other anarchists, rejected all forms of authority and political action, but who looked to the power of the working class, organized through trade unions, as the force capable of overthrowing capitalism.\nIn November 1910, representatives from anarchosyndicalist unions across Spain met in Barcelona to found the CNT, a national union. As Vernon Richards describes:\n\nBy its constitution the CNT was independent of all the political parties in Spain, and abstained from taking part in parliamentary and other elections. Its objectives were to bring together the exploited masses in the struggle for day-to-day improvements of working and economic conditions and for the revolutionary destruction of capitalism and the state. Its ends were Libertarian Communism, a social system based on the free commune federated at local, regional and national levels. Complete autonomy was the basis of this federation, the only ties with the whole being the agreements of a general nature adopted by Ordinary or Extraordinary National Congresses.6\n\nWhile the militant \u00e9lan of the CNT led to successful strikes, this penchant for loose organization and lack of centralized coordination, in the words of Murray Bookchin, a sympathetic chronicler, often led to \"sporadic, ill-time outbursts, easily crushed by the government.\"7\nThe anarchist revolutionaries in the CNT formed the Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista Ib\u00e9rica (FAI) in 1927, to guard against reformism within the CNT, as well as to maintain its opposition to any \"infiltration\" by other political forces. FAI militants, for example, were instrumental in winning the expulsion in 1931 of a group of 30 CNT leaders, the treintistas, who sought to make the CNT more syndicalist and less anarchist, criticizing the CNT for allowing small groups of militants to substitute their own armed actions for mass struggle. \"The revolution,\" the treintistas wrote, \"does not trust exclusively in the audacity of a more or less courageous minority, but instead it seeks to be a movement of the whole working class marching towards its final liberation.\"8\nAt the same time, the CNT often viewed workers who were not members as traitors to the revolution. At the 1919 national congress, the CNT leadership passed a resolution giving the workers of Spain a period of three months in which to enter the CNT, failing which they would be denounced as scabs.9 This was not an insignificant statement\u0096it reflected a tendency to see the key divide in society as one not between workers and bosses, but between authoritarians and nonauthoritarians.\nAlthough the CNT gained a substantial following among many of the newly arrived workers in Catalonia and the agricultural laborers of Arag\u00f3n by leading a number of militant strikes following the First World War, the Socialist-controlled Uni\u00f3n General del Trabajadores (UGT), with half a million members, was still the largest union in the country. Although the UGT was weighted down with a conservative leadership, any successful workers\u0092 movement\u0096let alone a successful workers\u0092 revolution\u0096would have to include the UGT\u0092s rank and file.\n\nThe birth of the Republic\nFaced with growing opposition from Spanish workers after the First World War, the Spanish ruling class fell back on its traditional crutch, the military. In 1923, General Miguel Primo de Rivera took power under a military dictatorship. Even Primo de Rivera\u0092s dictatorship, however, could not ensure order against the growing tide of struggle. When the Great Depression broke out in 1929, Spain fell into a severe economic crisis, and the ruling class found that it could no longer contain the growing anger with brute force.\nIn 1930, Primo de Rivera was forced to resign. King Alfonso XIII called for democratic elections, ushering in the First Republic and five years of social unrest, during which the political right and left vied for control. Elections held in April 1931 went overwhelmingly to the republican parties, forcing King Alfonso to abdicate the throne and flee the country. The government of the Second Republic (the First Republic, formed in 1873, lasted only a year), led by Manuel Aza\u00f1a, was composed of a coalition of the middle-class republican parties and the right wing of the Spanish Socialist Party, the Partido Socialista Obrero Espa\u00f1ol (PSOE). The PSOE provided a left-wing cover for a strictly bourgeois government that, from the outset, showed little interest in pursuing all but the most innocuous reforms.\nLand reform was perhaps the most pressing issue in all of Spain. Agricultural products accounted for half of the country\u0092s income and two-thirds of its exports. Seventy percent of Spain\u0092s population worked the land, yet a small class of landowners controlled two-thirds of all the country\u0092s arable land, most of it held in large estates. Of the 5 million peasants in Spain, 1.5 million lived as sharecroppers and another 1.5 million were landless workers.10 Starvation and hunger for the Spanish peasantry were as routine as the planting and harvesting of crops.\nThe immediate solution was the confiscation of the large estates and the redistribution of land to millions of poor peasants, but this reform went to the heart of Spanish capitalism. Land in Spain was mortgaged and heavily indebted to Spanish banks. Any expropriation of the large estates threatened not only the large landowners; it would wipe out loans owed to the banks, crippling Spanish capital. So the government stalled. It passed agricultural reforms that provided landowners compensation for any re-divided land. By the government\u0092s own figures, this redistribution would take more than 100 years.11\nThe republican-Socialist coalition also faced nationalist opposition from Catalan and Basque minorities within Spain and maintained a tenuous hold on a large portion of Morocco, which had been seized by the monarchy in a brutal imperial war that had lasted from 1912 to 1926. The national question was not simply a matter of justice for oppressed minorities; it was a matter of survival for the Republic. The colonial garrisons in Morocco were the most reactionary, brutal sections of the armed forces. The Spanish Foreign Legion and local mercenary groups that had carried out a war of attrition against the Moroccan people were a breeding ground for monarchist and fascist ideas. Any attack on the Republic would likely come from those sections of the armed forces. But the republican government would not give up its colonial possessions; it had its own imperial ambitions. \nIn less than two months, the republican-Socialist coalition traded its first blows with the workers\u0092 movement. In May 1931, members of the Civil Guard shot 10 workers after a clash with monarchist groups. In July, a general strike broke out in Seville in support of a walkout by local telephone workers. The government declared martial law. Forty workers died and more than 200 were wounded in the ensuing street battles.\nThe republican government was paralyzed between the aspirations of the workers and peasants who had elected it into power and its continued defense of the bourgeoisie. It was incapable of carrying through even the most basic democratic reforms. Reforms could only be defended and extended by strengthening the power of working-class organizations. Only by calling into question the very existence of the bourgeois government could the workers\u0092 movement be strengthened. As Trotsky wrote prophetically in 1931:\n\nThe Madrid government...promises strong measures against unemployment and land-hunger, but it does not dare to touch a single one of the social ulcers.... The discordance between the progress of the mass revolution and the policy of the new ruling classes\u0096that is the source of the irreconcilable conflict that, in its future development, will either bury the first revolution or produce a second one.12\n\nThe struggle over democratic demands was not simply a fight for a less repressive state; it was at the core of the fight for workers\u0092 power and socialism. The working class, as Trotsky argued, was the only class capable of leading the fight for democratic demands for the peasantry and the oppressed minorities; but, in that fight, it was bound also to fight for its own, socialist aspirations.\nThe anarchists had stood aloof from the democratic struggles for the republic. In Catalonia, a CNT stronghold, and in the Basque provinces, the anarchists did not advocate the right of self-determination, leaving the issue in the hands of the middle-class nationalists. And, while it organized demonstrations against the conscription of Spanish workers to fight in Morocco, it all but ignored that country\u0092s struggle for independence.13 The anarchists\u0092 apoliticism led them to vacillate between complete indifference to the struggles for democratic reforms and wild ultra-leftism when antidemocratic laws were used to repress them. Having played little role in the formation of the Republic, the anarchists then faced its betrayals and repression by leaping into an adventurous cycle of insurrections that paved the way for the return of the right wing.\nIn January 1932, anarchists launched an insurrection in the Catalan mining town of Alto Llobregat. The military suppressed it almost immediately. In January 1933, they initiated a call for an insurrection in support of a strike of railway workers. Sporadic uprisings broke out in Catalonia, Valencia, and parts of Andalusia. They were uniformly crushed almost immediately. The centralized Spanish army had no trouble isolating and defeating each revolt in succession. The insurrections had little active support and were further hampered by the anarchists\u0092 insistence on federalism and autonomy. As C\u00e9sar M. Lorenzo, son of the CNT\u0092s national secretary, describes, the federal structure of the CNT-FAI made it impossible to coordinate actions, even for those who wanted to, among the various sections:\n\nWithin the CNT everyone had his own opinion, everyone acted according to his own judgment, the leaders were ceaselessly criticized and challenged, the autonomy of the regional federations was inviolable, just as the autonomy of the local federations and unions was inviolable within the regional federations. To get a decision accepted...a militant had to exhaust himself making speeches, personal contacts, moving from place to place. Among the libertarians the ballot was repugnant; the unanimity they sought required interminable debates.14\n\nAs Frederick Engels noted of the role of the Bakuninist anarchists in the 1873 insurrection in Spain,\n\nNothing remains of the so-called principles of anarchy, free federation of independent groups, etc., but the boundless, and senseless fragmentation of the revolutionary resources, which enabled the government to conquer one city after another with a handful of soldiers, practically unresisted.15\n\nThe insurrections were isolated also by the anarchists\u0092 insistence that anyone who opposed their adventure was on the other side. In a characteristic statement during one of its uprisings in 1933, the FAI declared that \"all those who do not cooperate in the armed insurrection are traitors!\"16\nJust a week after the January insurrections, anarchists in the small village of Casas Viejas rose up and seized nearby land, proclaiming a libertarian society. The government ordered the military to restore order. In the fighting, the military killed hundreds, burning some alive. Pictures of the massacre of peasants, armed with hatchets and scythes, by soldiers who were armed with rifles and artillery infuriated the public and helped to seal the fate of the Aza\u00f1a government; but the cycle of insurrections took a heavy toll on the anarchists. Thousands of union militants were arrested. As Murray Bookchin notes in his history of anarchism before the civil war, \"Perhaps the example set by the uprising succeeded in fostering the militancy of the growing left factions in the Socialist Party, but apart from strike actions and terrorism, it completely exhausted the movement.\"17\nWith the anarchists in retreat and the PSOE discredited for its role in the republican government, the right took the initiative. The right-wing parties began cynically exposing the atrocities of the Casas Viejas massacre in their press, and even formed their own tribunals to examine abuses by the military. All of this was a self-serving attempt to embarrass the Aza\u00f1a government by groups that had nothing but contempt for the peasantry, but in the absence of an alternative from the left, it allowed the right to gain the upper hand.\nThe CNT played its part in the elections, arguing, \"Workers! Don\u0092t Vote!... Destroy the ballot boxes...crack the heads of the ballot supervisors as well as the candidates.\"18 When elections were called in November 1933, the right won an overwhelming victory, ushering in what became known as El Bienio Negro, the two black years. \n\nReaction and revolt\nThe right-wing government that took power in November 1933, headed by Alejandro Lerroux, did so against the backdrop of the rise of fascism in Europe. Hitler had been appointed chancellor of Germany in January by the conservative president Hindenburg. In March, the Austrian fascist, Englebert Dolfuss, had convinced the Austrian president to cede him dictatorial powers. Austrian workers rose up heroically to defeat Dolfuss, but were crushed. Many Spanish workers feared that Spain would be next. After the November elections, the largest number of seats in the Cortes was held by members of the Confederaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Derechas Aut\u00f3nomas (CEDA), a confederation of industrialists, monarchists, and admirers of Mussolini and Dolfuss, led by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gil Robles. \nThe membership of the PSOE and UGT, radicalized by the failure of the German Social-Democrats to put up any resistance to the rise of fascism and by the Austrian workers\u0092 fierce resistance, put pressure on their leadership to prevent any attempt by Gil Robles to take power. Moderate PSOE leaders Indalecio Prieto and Roman Gonz\u00e1les Pe\u00f1a publicly pledged in the Cortes that any attempt to install a fascist regime would be met with armed revolution. The large left wing, led by the Socialist Youth, declared that they were preparing for a proletarian revolution.19 A call went out for the formation of a broad united front of workers\u0092 organizations, known as the Alianza Obrera, to resist the advance of the right.\nOn October 1, members of CEDA demanded seats in the government, leading to the collapse of the Lerroux government. Lerroux formed a new cabinet that included four members of CEDA. The PSOE leadership, which only months before had promised armed resistance to Gil Robles, was now forced act. On October 4, the Alianza Obrera and the UGT called a nationwide general strike. In most places the strike was a tragic failure. The reformist PSOE leadership that had called for the strike had only partially committed to it. The start of the strike was postponed twice in hopes that an agreement could be reached with Lerroux to remove CEDA from the cabinet. When the UGT finally issued a strike call, it was on short notice and following a declaration of martial law that enabled the government to arrest hundred of Socialist organizers.\nOnly in the mining center of Asturias did the strike take on truly revolutionary proportions. There, the UGT, Communists, and the CNT had all entered into the Alianza Obrera, signing a pact that committed them to work together \"until they obtain a social revolution in Spain.\" On the night of October 4, sirens announced the beginning of the strike. Joint militias attacked the barracks of the Civil Guards, disarming them. Miners marched on the capital, Oviedo, liberating towns along the route and gathering forces. When the miners took control of cities, they redistributed land to the peasants and seized the mines and factories. When they reached the capital, an armed column of 8,000 miners occupied the city. For 15 days the beleaguered miners of Asturias held out against the troops of the Foreign Legion. In the slaughter that followed, more than 3,000 were killed and thousands more were imprisoned.20\nThe various workers\u0092 organizations had joined spontaneously in Asturias. The October rebellion showed the potential of a united workers\u0092 movement and the desire of many rank-and-file workers from all parties for unity. When the CNT national leadership rebuked the local CNT committee for having signed such a pact without their consent, the rank-and-file miners responded, \"In social struggles, as in other wars, victory always goes to those who previously got together and jointly organized their forces.\"21 Nationally, though, the call for united action through the Alianza Obrera was rejected by the CNT, who opposed the participation of the PSOE. \nIn response to the call for the Alianza Obrera, the anarchist leader, Buenaventura Durruti, argued, \"The alliance, to be revolutionary, must be genuinely working class. It must be the result of an agreement between the workers\u0092 organizations, and those alone. No party, however socialist it may be, can belong to a workers\u0092 alliance.\"22 Essentially, the CNT\u0092s message was \"We refuse to unite in struggle with workers who have yet to agree to march under our banner.\" An abstract opposition to \"politics\" led the anarchists away from united working-class action.23\nThe CNT\u0092s hostility to the Socialists was fueled by the opportunism of the PSOE. Though rhetorically to the left of other social-democratic parties in Europe, it had long since abandoned revolutionary politics. The leadership of the PSOE saw the Alianza Obrera as nothing more than a paper alliance. But by dismissing calls for unity and political struggle, the anarchists turned their backs on millions of workers ready to unite in struggle against the right, leaving them under the vacillating leadership of the reformists and centrists of the PSOE. The anarchists\u0092 apolitical radicalism was merely the flip side of the PSOE\u0092s craven opportunism. As the Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin argued in 1917:\n\nThe professional Cabinet Ministers and parliamentarians, the traitors to the proletariat and the \"practical\" socialists of our day, have left all criticism of parliament to the anarchists. It is not surprising that the proletariat of the \"advanced\" parliamentary countries, disgusted with such \"socialists\"...has been with increasing frequency giving its sympathies to anarchosyndicalism, in spite of the fact that the latter is merely the twin brother of opportunism.24\n\nFor Lerroux\u0092s right-wing coalition, however, the rebellion in Asturias was the beginning of the end. The right had been thoroughly discredited and a new militancy was growing among workers and the peasantry. When new elections were called, few people doubted the outcome.\n\nFrom Popular Front to revolution\nIn February 1936, an electoral alliance between the main parties of the middle-class and the main workers\u0092 parties, known as the Popular Front, came to power in Spain. The CNT and the FAI had declined to join the Popular Front, affirming their opposition to all political action. But in practice, the CNT-FAI dropped its abstentionism and gave tacit approval to its members to vote for the Popular Front, thereby assuring its narrow victory.\nThe Popular Front came to power on the heels of a massive wave of strikes and peasant rebellions. Although its program consisted of reforms specifically designed not to alienate the bourgeoisie, most workers and peasants saw the victory of the Popular Front as the beginning of larger battles. As one Madrid socialist put it:\n\n[The workers] wanted to go forward, they weren\u0092t satisfied simply with the release of political prisoners and the return to their jobs of all those who had been sacked as a result of the revolutionary insurrection of October 1934. Instinctively, they were pressing forward, not necessarily to take power, not to create soviets, but to push forward the revolution which had begun with the republic\u0092s proclamation.25\n\nThe ruling class saw the Popular Front victory as a declaration of war. Lerroux\u0092s right-wing coalition had been unable to restrain the workers\u0092 movement; now large sections of the ruling class dropped their half-hearted support for the Republic and swung behind a dictatorial solution. Soon after the elections, a motley coalition of high-ranking army officers, monarchists, and fascists began plotting a military coup.\nOn the morning of July 17, the army garrison in Spanish-held Morocco rose in revolt under the direction of General Francisco Franco. Garrisons revolted in most major cities. From the beginning it was clear that this was an attack not only on the Popular Front government, but also on the working-class organizations that had brought it to power. After seizing control of the Seville garrison on July 17, General Gonzalo Queipo de Llano signed a proclamation declaring that the leaders of any labor union on strike would \"immediately be shot\" as well as \"an equal number of members selected discretionally.\"26\nThe Popular Front government received word of the uprising within hours, but kept silent for an entire day. Even on the afternoon of July 18, the government offered only a note that read, \"The Government speaks again in order to confirm the absolute tranquility of the whole Peninsula.\" Instead, on the night of July 18, the government dissolved itself and formed a new cabinet of right-wing politicians outside the Popular Front. Rather than fight the fascists, the government\u0092s first reaction was to appease them. The workers, however, responded immediately. It was a pattern that would be repeated throughout the war. The Popular Front government stalled and prevaricated, hoping until the last moment to avoid confrontation, and the working class led the struggle against the fascists. \nThe CNT and the UGT demanded that the Popular Front government arm the workers, but it refused. Ignoring the government\u0092s pleas, detachments of workers stormed army barracks, seized weapons and began distributing them to anyone with a trade union or party membership card. They quickly organized defenses, creating armed patrols, arresting fascist sympathizers, and building barricades. Within days, the revolt was defeated in many cities and Franco\u0092s forces were being rolled back out of the province of Arag\u00f3n. But wherever the Popular Front government successfully prevented workers from mobilizing, the rebellion succeeded. Writes historian Hugh Thomas:\n\nNearly everywhere on July 18, the civil governors followed the example of the government of Madrid, and refused to cooperate with the working-class organizations who were clamoring for arms. In many cases, this brought the success of the risings and signed the death warrants of the civil governors themselves, along with local working-class leaders.27\n\nHistorians Brou\u00e9 and Tem\u00edme write:\n\nIn effect, each time that the workers\u0092 organizations allowed themselves to be paralyzed by their anxiety to respect Republican legality and each time that their leaders were satisfied with what was said by the officers, the latter prevailed. On the other hand, the Movimiento was repulsed whenever the workers had time to arm and whenever they set about the destruction of the army as such, independently of their leaders\u0092 positions or the attitude of \"legitimate\" public authorities.28\n\nAlthough the Popular Front government remained in power, the state apparatus it depended on had collapsed. Most army officers were sympathetic to Franco, and the soldiers had either joined the uprising or the workers\u0092 resistance. Many industrialists and landowners fled to rebel-held territory.\nAs the old society began to fall apart, the workers\u0092 movement organized new structures in its place. The trade unions commandeered cars and trucks to transport members of the newly formed workers\u0092 militias; they formed ambulance services and worker-run hospitals. Communal kitchens and transportation centers were organized.29 In the cities, workers took over factories and placed them under workers\u0092 control. They elected representatives to oversee production and coordinate work in the shops. George Orwell, who arrived in Barcelona six months after the uprising, wrote a moving description of the city under workers\u0092 control in his book Homage to Catalonia:\n\nIt was the first time that I had ever been in a town where the working class was in the saddle. Practically every building of any size had been seized by the workers and was draped with red flags or with the red and black flag of the Anarchists; every wall was scrawled with the hammer and sickle and with the initials of the revolutionary parties.... Every shop and caf\u00e9 had an inscription saying that it had been collectivized; even the bootblacks had been collectivized and their boxes painted red and black. Waiters and shop-walkers looked you in the face and treated you as an equal.... \nThe revolutionary posters were everywhere, flaming from the walls in clean reds and blues that made the few remaining wall advertisements look like daubs of mud. Down the Ramblas, the wide central artery of the town, were crowds of people streaming constantly to and fro, the loud-speakers were bellowing revolutionary songs all day and far into the night.... There was much in it that I did not understand, in some ways I did not even like it, but I recognized it immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for.30\nIn the countryside, peasants took control of the land, redistributing large estates and, in many places, collectivizing the land and setting up communes. An anarchist in the town of Membrilla, described their local commune:\nOn July 22, the big landowners were expropriated, small property was liquidated, and all the land passed into the hands of the commune.... \nThe local treasury was empty. Among private individuals the sum of thirty thousand pesetas in all was found and seized. All the food, the clothing, the tools, etc., were distributed equitably along the population. Money was abolished, labor was collectivized, property was taken over by the community, and the distribution of consumer goods was socialized.... \nThree liters of wine are distributed to every person per week. Rent, electricity, water, medical attention and medicines are free.31\n\n\nWar and revolution\nFrom the beginning, the republican parties had nothing but contempt for the revolution: \"The Revolution commenced under a republican government that neither wished to support it nor could support it.\"32 But by 1936, the republican parties had little mass support. They held on to power largely through the support they received from the left. As it had during the first period of the republic, the leadership of the PSOE continued to defend the republican parties. Now the Spanish Communist Party (PCE) joined them.\nBefore the civil war, the PCE had been an insignificant party. It had failed to gain a large following after its founding in 1921, and since Stalin\u0092s rise to power in Russia, it had abandoned any commitment to revolutionary struggle and become little more than a tool of Soviet foreign policy. Now, after a brief period of ultra-leftism in the early 1930s, in which it refused to work jointly with reformist workers\u0092 organizations, the PCE flipped over to become the leading advocate of the Popular Front. The PCE hoped to win the support of the Allies to join a coalition against fascism at a time when the Soviet Union was facing increasing hostility from the Nazi government in Germany. \nFrom the first days of the war, the Popular Front government, with the support of the PSOE and the PCE, passed restrictions on the ability of peasants to seize large land holdings and on workers\u0092 ability to run factories under workers\u0092 control. It passed laws stating that under no condition would the private property of foreign firms be seized. Only by restraining the demands of the workers and peasants, the Popular Front government and its supporters argued, could it maintain unity between all antifascist forces, including the bourgeoisie. Jos\u00e9 Diaz, leader of the PCE wrote:\n\nIf in the beginning the various premature attempts at \"socialization\" and \"collectivization\"...might have been justified...at the present time, when there is a government of the Popular Front, in which all the forces engaged in the fight against fascism are represented, such things are not only not desirable, but absolutely impermissible.33\n\nThus the left became the last defenders of the bourgeois order.\nBoth the PCE and the PSOE tried to underwrite their alliance with bourgeois forces by arguing that Spain needed first to have a bourgeois revolution, and only after this could it have a workers\u0092 revolution. But the bourgeoisie and much of the armed forces saw Franco\u0092s rebellion as the only force capable of restoring order and protecting capitalism against the advances of the workers and peasants.\nEach attempt to appease the bourgeoisie by suppressing the class struggle and the peasants\u0092 fight for land weakened the fight against fascism. Only by strengthening the organizations of workers and peasants, and only by offering a political program based upon land redistribution and workers\u0092 power, could the loyalist side hope to overcome the fascists. Not unity with the bourgeoisie, but a sharp break with the bourgeoisie (which had, after all, tried to prevent workers from taking up arms against the fascists) was necessary to defeat Franco. As Trotsky wrote at the time:\n\nA civil war is waged, as everyone knows, not only with military but also with political weapons. From a purely military point of view, the Spanish revolution is much weaker than its enemy. Its strength lies in its ability to rouse the great masses to action. It can even take away the army from its reactionary officers. To accomplish this, it is only necessary to seriously and courageously advance the program of the socialist revolution.34\n\nAn immediate redistribution of the large landed estates would have won the support of millions of peasants to the government, including many conservative peasants who had joined the clerical and monarchist forces in Franco\u0092s army. A declaration of independence for Morocco would have undercut Franco\u0092s support in North Africa, and even opened up a second front against his forces in Morocco. The immediate nationalization of industry and banking would have prevented the bourgeoisie from sabotaging war production by reopening closed plants and seizing money that could be used to purchase arms.\nThe Popular Front government could not pursue these basic tasks because they threatened the very existence of the bourgeoisie. Only a revolutionary government led by the working class could enact them. The workers controlled the streets and the factories, but that would not continue indefinitely. Either the workers would seize power in a new revolution or Franco and his supporters would crush the  Republic.\n\nThe failure to seize power\nThe CNT was in control of much of Republican Spain and had power in its hands. In the Catalan capital of Barcelona, the leaders of the CNT-FAI were called into the offices of Luis Companys, head of the regional government. There Companys told them, \"Today you are masters of the city and of Catalonia.... You have conquered and everything is in your power; if you do not need or want me as president of Catalonia, tell me now.\"35\nThe delegates of the CNT were surprised by this frank admission: \"He saw the situation more clearly than us because he hadn\u0092t been in the thick of the street fighting. One of us replied, \u0091We have come to no decision about this, consequently we cannot give an answer. We would have to return and report to the CNT.\u0092\"36\nThe choice was posed clearly: Either the CNT would overthrow the old government and establish a revolutionary government in Catalonia, or the Popular Front would remain in power and slowly strangle both the revolution and the fight against Franco. The CNT, however, was not prepared for the choice.\nOn July 23, the Catalan Regional Committee of the CNT-FAI called a meeting to discuss whether to overthrow the Catalan government. Initially, FAI leader Juan Garc\u00eda Oliver, who later entered the national government as minister of justice, argued to \"go for everything,\" overthrow the government and establish libertarian communism. If the government were overthrown, however, it would have to be replaced by a workers\u0092 government led by the CNT-FAI. The anarchists believed any such state would be a dictatorship, a mortal blow to their anti-statist principles. Federica Montseny argued that \"her conscience as an anarchist would not permit her to accept...to go for everything as Garc\u00eda Oliver proposed, because the installation of an anarchist dictatorship, because it was a dictatorship, could never be anarchist.\"37 And Mariano V\u00e1zquez, the regional secretary of the Catalan CNT, opposed \"compromising the Organization [CNT] in dictatorial practices.\"38\nLooking back on the decision, FAI leader Diego Abad de Santill\u00e1n wrote:\n\nWe could have remained alone, imposed our absolute will, declared the Generalidad null and void, and imposed the true power of the people in its place, but we did not believe in dictatorship when it was being exercised against us, and we did not want it when we could exercise it ourselves only at the expense of others. The Generalidad would remain in force with President Companys at its head, and the popular forces would organize themselves into militias to carry on the struggle for the liberation of Spain.39\n\nWhen the final vote was taken, Garc\u00eda Oliver backed down, and only one delegate voted in favor of overthrowing the government. The CNT announced that it would support Companys remaining as head of the government. \nMany anarchists at the time and since have tried to justify\u0096or at least explain\u0096the decision of the CNT to leave the government intact and even offer support. Some maintain that no such decision needed to be made. \"The dilemma of the \u0091Anarchist and Confederal dictatorship\u0092 or \u0091Collaboration and democracy,\u0092\" writes anarchist Vernon Richards, \"existed only for those \u0091influential militants\u0092 of the CNT-FAI who, wrongly interpreting their functions as delegates, took upon themselves the task of directing the popular movement.\"40 For Richards the problem exists only because Garc\u00eda Oliver and others were \"authoritarian\" enough to acknowledge it. But Richards is only sidestepping the problem. A real dilemma did exist for the thousands of anarchists. \nMost anarchists cite the war and the necessity of maintaining unity in the fight against fascism as the reason for not overthrowing the state. As Gaston Leval, a French anarchist who fought with the CNT militias, explains:\n\nThe anarchists, too, faced with the fascist peril, the suppression of free speech and the right to organize, faced with the inevitable persecutions of all those who would not submit to dictatorship, realized that everyone must unite against fascism.41\n\nHere the anarchists are only aping the arguments of the Stalinists, accepting the political and later physical disarming of the Spanish working class for the sake of \"antifascist unity.\" \nThe Popular Front government had already shown itself unwilling to lead a determined struggle against Franco for fear of alienating the bourgeoisie at home and abroad. A determined struggle against fascism could only be led by the workers; but the state could not be sidestepped. It had to be overturned and replaced with a workers\u0092 government capable of waging the war along revolutionary lines. By renouncing their intention to overturn the bourgeois state, the anarchists merely showed the inability of their theories to provide a way forward.\nThe anarchist movement had always assumed that the social revolution would solve the question of the state. Now, in a revolutionary situation, the anarchists faced a situation of dual power in which either a workers\u0092 state or a bosses\u0092 state was posed sharply. As Leval again explains:\n\nAt the end of 1936, all those among the anarchists who were preoccupied primarily with the revolutionary question oversimplified and underestimated the political problem. The social revolution would sweep away the entrenched powers and institutions. The political parties would disappear. The parasitic classes, no longer able to count on the support of the state, would disappear. And all that would remain to be done would be to organize the new anarchist society. But the necessity of fighting the war against fascism completely upset these expectations. The state continued to exist.42\n\nThe revolutionary Marxist tradition, contrary to the claims of the anarchists, had always maintained the necessity of destroying the bourgeois state. Its opposition to anarchism had always been that immediately following a revolution it is necessary to replace the bourgeois state with a workers\u0092 government capable of suppressing the forces of reaction. As Lenin writes in State and Revolution: \n\nWe do not at all disagree with the Anarchists on the question of the abolition of the state as an aim. We maintain that, to achieve this aim, temporary use must be made of the instruments, means and methods of the state power against the exploiters, just as the dictatorship of the oppressed class is temporarily necessary for the annihilation of classes.43\n\nAgain and again, the anarchists found themselves in the same dilemma. To overthrow the state meant replacing it with a revolutionary government led by the CNT-FAI. Anarchists rejected this as dictatorship. If the CNT-FAI refused power, the government would remain in the hands of class forces hostile to the revolution and unwilling to continue the revolutionary struggle that had arrested Franco\u0092s advance. Trotsky writes:\n\nIn and of itself, this self-justification that \"we did not seize power not because we were unable but because we did not wish to, because we were against every kind of dictatorship,\" and the like, contains an irrevocable condemnation of anarchism as an utterly anti-revolutionary doctrine. To renounce the conquest of power is voluntarily to leave the power with those who wield it, the exploiters. The essence of every revolution consisted and consists in putting a new class in power, thus enabling it to realize its own program in life. It is impossible to wage war and to reject victory. It is impossible to lead the masses towards insurrection without preparing for the conquest of power.44\n\nEven the CNT\u0092s enemies saw its failure clearly. Major Frederic Escofet, a moderate Catalan republican, wrote:\n\n[The CNT found itself] virtually in control of the streets, the arms and transportation, in other words, with power in its hands; its leaders, who were bold and energetic and experienced fighters, were disoriented. They had no plan, no clear doctrine, no idea what they should do or what they should allow others to do. The CNT concept of libertarian communism was devoid of realism and was silent as to the road it should follow in a revolutionary period.45\n\n\nFrom contempt to collaboration\nIn Madrid, the Popular Front government was still in power, but had little support. The republican parties\u0092 base of support, already weak in July, had evaporated after Franco\u0092s initial victories. In an attempt to widen support for the government, President Manuel Aza\u00f1a invited the left Socialist and head of the UGT, Francisco Largo Caballero, to form a new government with Cabellero as prime minister. Caballero was a reformist turned radical who combined fiery speeches in support of the revolution with continued collaboration with the party\u0092s right wing and the Popular Front government.\nIn September, Caballero formed a government composed of the Socialist, Communist, and left Republican parties. But, from the beginning he was insistent that the CNT be included in the government. Claridad, the publication of Caballero\u0092s faction of PSOE, wrote, \"The entry of the representatives of the CNT into the present Council of Ministers would certainly endow the directive organ of the nation with fresh energy and authority, in view of the fact that a considerable segment of the working class, now absent from its deliberations, would feel bound by its measures and its authority.\"46\nInitially, the CNT refused Caballero\u0092s offer of a single seat in the cabinet. They hoped that the strength of the militias and the factory committees would be sufficient to defend the revolution. \"The militia committees guarantee the supremacy of the people in arms,\" wrote Abad de Santill\u00e1n.47 But as the Communists and right-wing Socialists began using their control over supply lines to starve the revolutionary organizations of food and arms, the anarchists realized that they could not remain indifferent to the composition of the government. Having renounced the intention of overthrowing the state, the CNT-FAI opted for collaboration with it! When Caballero agreed to give the CNT-FAI four seats in the government, the CNT-FAI accepted. \nThe CNT-FAI\u0092s decision to join a government, and a capitalist government no less, was a complete betrayal of the stated aims of anarchism and utterly compromised the anarchists. Looking back on the decision, Federica Montseny, then minister of health and social welfare, wrote: \n\nAs a consequence, the state recovered the position it had lost, while we revolutionaries, who formed part of the state, helped it to do so. That was why we were brought into the government. Although we did not enter it with that intention, we were in it, and therefore had no alternative but remain imprisoned in the vicious circle.48 \n\nThe CNT-FAI now joined Caballero and the Communists as the last defenders of the bourgeois order.\nIn the aftermath of the civil war, few anarchists support the CNT\u0092s decision to enter the government. Even at the time, the CNT-FAI received severe criticism from anarchists abroad. But what anarchist critics fail to do is provide any alternative, any way out of the dilemma in which the CNT-FAI found itself. Jos\u00e9 Peirats, who during the civil war had been a leader in the libertarian youth movement and a strident critic of collaboration, describes the paralysis of the opponents of collaboration:\n\nAt the distance of many years, I think that those of us who opposed consistently the governmentalist thesis could not have offered any other way of resolving the problems of the time than a stoic and heroic gesture. I think, also, that there was an unconfessed complicity in many militants opposed to collaboration, who shouted their holy ire at the same time they allowed it to happen.... They couldn\u0092t offer any solution.49\n\nAnarchist critics are unable to provide a solution because they accept the theoretical underpinnings that led the CNT-FAI leaders away from the seizure of power and toward collaboration. Helmut Ruediger, representative of the International Workingmen\u0092s Association in Barcelona, himself a critic of the CNT, acknowledged the opposition\u0092s dilemma in his response to the criticisms of foreign anarchists such as Emma Goldman: \n\nThose who say that the CNT should have established its own dictatorship in 1936 do not know what they are demanding.... The CNT would have needed a government program, a program for exercising power; [it would have needed] training in the exercise of power, an economic plan centrally directed, and experience in the use of the state apparatus.... The CNT had none of these. Nor do those who believe that the CNT should have implanted its own dictatorship have such a program, either for their own country or for Spain. Do not let us delude ourselves! \n\nFurthermore, had it possessed such a program before July 19, the CNT would not have been the CNT; it would have been a Bolshevik party, and, had it applied such methods to the Revolution, it would have dealt Anarchism a mortal blow.50\nThe minority of anarchists who rejected collaboration and tried to find a way out of the impasse of anarchism were forced to break with key aspects of anarchist theory and move toward revolutionary Marxism. The Friends of Durruti, formed in March 1937, was a small group of anarchists based in Barcelona who broke with what they called \"apolitical anarchism\":\n\nTo beat Franco we need to crush the bourgeoisie and its Stalinist and Socialist Allies. The capitalist state must be destroyed totally and there must be installed workers\u0092 power depending on rank-and-file workers\u0092 committees. Apolitical anarchism has failed.51\n\nIn response to this call for the overthrow of the Popular Front and its replacement with a revolutionary government, the CNT leadership demanded their expulsion from the union.\nThe defense of Madrid and the rise of the Communists\nThe very week the anarchists joined the government, Caballero showed just how shallow the Popular Front government\u0092s conviction to fight the fascists was. When Franco\u0092s forces moved to within a few miles of the capital, Madrid, rather than again arm the workers and call for a defense of the city, the new government\u0092s first act was to vote unanimously to flee the capital (the anarchist ministers abstained from the vote, but did not publicly criticize the decision), leaving behind virtually no organized defense of the city.\nAbandoned by the government, the inhabitants of Madrid began scrambling to build defenses. One young man recalled: \"When the government left, we felt betrayed.... Everyone expected the enemy to take the city. But they didn\u0092t. The climate began to change. There were calls everywhere to defend the city. \u0091Better to die than to live on your knees.\u0092\"52\nMen, women, and even children hastily gathered arms and set out for the front. The union of streetcar workers began running free shuttles from the working-class quarters to the front. For weeks, workers fought the fascists street by street, house by house, showing incredible heroism. Men and women often went to the front unarmed, waiting to relieve someone or waiting for a comrade to fall in battle so they could take up arms. Revolutionary posters went up around the city that read, \"MADRID WILL BE THE TOMB OF FASCISM! No pasar\u00e1n! [\"They shall not pass!\"] Every house a fortress, every street a trench, every neighborhood a wall of iron and combatants.\"53\nAfter a month of bitter fighting, Franco\u0092s forces began withdrawing from the Madrid suburbs that had been captured at the beginning of November. The Popular Front had won its first significant victory of the war. Victory had come through the tremendous initiatives and sacrifices of the workers of Madrid, but it was the Communist Party that would claim credit.\nWhen the Popular Front government had fled Madrid, it had taken with them the leaderships of all the leading political parties and trade unions except the Communists. The organization of the defense of the city was left largely in their hands. After the defense of Madrid, the Communist press printed glowing accounts of how the Communists had saved Madrid, of the heroism of the Communist-controlled International Brigades, and of the support received from the Soviet Union during the defense. \nThe PCE and its corollary in Catalonia, the Partit Socialista Unificat de Catalunya (PSUC), had grown from insignificant organizations at the outbreak of the civil war to mass organizations that included many heroic workers who gave their lives in Madrid, but these were not revolutionary workers\u0092 parties. The Communists\u0092 principle demands had been the defense of private property and the limiting of the revolution. In 1936, the majority of its members were small landowners, intellectuals, and members of the urban middle class.54\nAfter the defense of Madrid, the Communists used their newfound popularity to begin to take control of the Popular Army and police forces, recruiting or winning support from leading members of the right wing of the PSOE and many of the remaining officer corps. They then took full advantage of their position over the distribution of weapons to withhold ammunition and supplies from the workers\u0092 militias of the CNT and the Partido Obrero de Unificaci\u00f3n Marxista (POUM), a small anti-Stalinist party based mainly in Catalonia. The aim was clear: to starve the revolution. But the Communists could not gain undisputed control of the war without settling scores with the anarchists, the POUM, and the revolutionary workers of Barcelona.\nBarcelona: The anarchist betrayal\nSince July, Barcelona and most of the province of Catalonia had been in an uneasy truce. The workers\u0092 organizations, particularly the CNT, controlled most aspects of daily life; but the regional government was slowly disbanding the revolutionary committees and trying to restore \"order.\" The changes bred resentment among most workers in Catalonia, but opposition had been compromised when the CNT and POUM had entered the regional government in September 1936. Instead, anger and frustration built over the winter. George Orwell, on leave from the front, described the changes in the city since his last visit:\n\n[Under] the surface-aspect of the town, under the luxury and growing poverty, under the seeming gaiety of the streets with their propaganda-posters, and thronging crowds, there was an unmistakable and horrible feeling of political rivalry and hatred. People of all shades of opinion were saying forebodingly: \"There\u0092s going to be trouble before long.\" The danger was quite simple and intelligible. It was the antagonism between those who wished the revolution to go forward and those who wished to check or prevent it\u0096ultimately, between Anarchists and Communists.55\n\nThe inevitable clash finally came on the morning of May 3, when three truckloads of Assault Guards, under the personal command of a PSUC minister, arrived at the anarchist-held Telephone Exchange with an eviction notice. This was a test of power. The Telephone Exchange had been seized by the CNT in the first days of fighting in July and had been run under workers\u0092 control ever since. It was widely regarded as the most visible symbol of workers\u0092 power in the city. \nThe CNT militants inside the building responded to the eviction order with bullets. Within hours, barricades were being erected all over the working-class districts of the city. \"Hundreds of workers armed themselves,\" wrote Augustine Souchy, a well-known German anarchist, \"constructing barricades and disarming the civil guard with their consent. No blood was spilled. The workers were masters of the situation.\"56 From the front, a joint column of CNT-POUM militia began a march on Barcelona to support the uprising.\nOnce the fighting started, two things were clear. First, the spontaneous uprising in Barcelona had the support of the majority of workers in Catalonia. Second, this provocation by the government was intended as an act of war against the revolution. This time there could be no collaboration; either the workers would move forward and overthrow the government, or their defeat would be the beginning of the end for the revolution. There were no guarantees that an uprising in Barcelona would have gained support outside of Catalonia, but a defeat in Barcelona guaranteed the defeat of the revolution.\nSome workers\u0092 organizations understood the need to take power. The Friends of Durruti argued for the disarming of the military and the disbanding of the Communist Party for organizing against the revolution. They also argued for the overthrow of the government and the formation of a revolutionary junta. Likewise, the small group of Trotskyists in Barcelona published a leaflet calling on workers to form revolutionary councils and for the seizure of power. But both groups were too small to influence events decisively. Leadership of the workers\u0092 movement still lay with the leadership of the CNT-FAI.\nThe Popular Front government appealed to the CNT-FAI, and Montseny and Oliver were dispatched to Barcelona to end the fighting. Over the radio, Oliver and later Montseny appealed to CNT militants to dismantle the barricades and return home. CNT leaders stopped the CNT militia column from continuing its march to Barcelona.57 In disgust, workers burned bundles of CNT newspapers at the barricades. \"I heard some comrades cry with rage over the telephone when they telephoned the [CNT-FAI] committees and the latter told them not to shoot, even though they were being attacked by machine-gun fire,\" wrote Abad de Santill\u00e1n.58 The barricades remained for another five days, but without the support of the CNT-FAI leadership, militants eventually retreated in frustration and disgust. The revolution had been defeated.\nThe months that followed were months of outright reaction. First the POUM and then the anarchists were purged from any position of power by the Communists. Thousands of revolutionaries disappeared into secret prisons to be tortured or killed. In June, POUM leader Andr\u00e9s Nin was kidnapped and executed by the Soviet secret police. Any vestige of revolutionary power\u0096the factory committees, the communes, the Council of Arag\u00f3n, the militias\u0096was forcibly disbanded.\nThe Popular Front government held out for nearly another two years, but from May 1937 on, its fate was sealed. Once the revolution was defeated, the civil war became a strictly military conflict. In a conventional war, the fascists held all the advantages\u0096money, equipment, troops. The tremendous heroism and sacrifice on the part of Spanish workers that had marked the early months of the war had been based on a belief that they were fighting for a new society. With that gone, there was little reason to risk everything. As one peasant soldier fighting on Franco\u0092s side shouted across the trenches to workers\u0092 appealing to him to switch sides, \"What has the republic done for us that we should fight for it?\"59 When Barcelona, the cradle of the revolution, fell to Franco on January 26, 1938, there were no barricades, there was no heroic defense. Manuel Tag\u00fce\u00f1a, the Communist Commander of the 15th Army Corp wrote, \"Barcelona accepted defeat with sorrow and saw no purpose at all in prolonging the fight. We were no longer in 1936.\"60\nConclusion\nThe apoliticism of the anarchist movement, its \"denial\" of political struggle, left it to drift between extreme militancy and collaboration. Responsibility for the defeat of the revolution must ultimately lie with Franco\u0092s army, the complicity of the PSOE leadership, and the treachery of the Communists\u0096but it also lay in the betrayal of the revolution by the anarchist leaders.\nThe failure of the CNT-FAI to take power and its subsequent collaboration was not in spite of its anarchist principles; it was a product of them. By rejecting the formation of a workers\u0092 government as a form of dictatorship and refusing to seize power, the CNT-FAI left itself no course but that of collaboration, covered up with phrases borrowed from the Stalinists about the need for \"antifascist unity.\" As Trotsky noted somewhat humorously at the time:\n\nWe have already heard from some Anarchist theoreticians that at the time of such \"exceptional\" circumstances as war and revolution, it is necessary to renounce the principles of one\u0092s own program. Such revolutionists bear a close resemblance to raincoats that leak only when it rains, i.e., in \"exceptional\" circumstances, but during dry weather they remain waterproof with complete success.61\n\nThe anarchists thus vacillated between ultra-left adventurism (the period of the insurrections and a complete rejection of politics) and complete accommodation (joining a bourgeois government) at the decisive revolutionary moment.\nAn alternative is necessary not as a historical exercise, but because it shapes the struggles of today. In trying to explain the failures of the CNT in the Spanish Revolution, some anarchists have taken exactly the wrong lessons and retreated from the very idea of class struggle altogether. Murray Bookchin writes that as a result of the failure of the Spanish Revolution\n\nThe limitations of the trade union movement, even in its anarchosyndicalist form, have become manifestly clear. To see in trade unions (whether syndicalist or not) an inherent potentiality for revolutionary struggle is to assume that the interests of workers and capitalists, merely as classes, are intrinsically incompatible. This is demonstrably untrue if one is willing to acknowledge the obvious capacity of the system to remake or to literally create the worker in the image of a repressive industrial culture and rationality.62\n\nAn inability to provide an alternative to the policies of the CNT-FAI has led Bookchin and others away from the idea that workers can struggle to remake the world in a more equal and democratic image. Today the anarchist movement is a far cry from the tradition of the CNT. It is dominated by middle-class, lifestyle politics, often explicitly rejecting workers\u0092 struggle as a means of liberating society.\nYet this is the greatest legacy of the Spanish Revolution. Whatever its failures, it stands as a heroic example of workers\u0092 struggle. Whatever its flaws, it gives a glimpse of what a socialist world could look like. But that alone is insufficient. While revolutionary socialists and anarchists share a common goal in a classless society, ultimately an alternative to capitalism must be found not within the tradition of Bakunin, Kropotkin, and Goldman, but with the revolutionary socialist tradition of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Trotsky.\n1\tLeon Trotsky, The Spanish Revolution, 1931\u00971939 (New York: Pathfinder Press, 1973), p. 316.\n2\tTrotsky, p. 24.\n3\tTrotsky, p. 24.\n4\tMurray Bookchin, The Spanish Anarchists: The Heroic Years, 1868\u00971936 (San Francisco: AK Press, 1998), pp. 61\u009763; Juan G\u00f3mez Casas, Anarchist Organization: The History of the FAI (Montreal: Black Rose Books, 1986), pp. 26\u009727. \n5\tMax Nomad, quoted in Bookchin, p. 116.\n6\tVernon Richards, The Lessons of the Spanish Revolution (London: Freedom Press, 1995), p. 17.\n7\tBookchin, p. 162.\n8\tQuoted in Hugh Thomas, The Spanish Civil War (London: Pelican, 1986), pp. 73\u009774.\n9\tBurnett Bolloten, The Spanish Civil War: Revolution and Counterrevolution (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1991), p. 197\n10\tFelix Morrow, Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Spain (New York: Pathfinder, 1974), p. 8.\n11\tMorrow, p. 10.\n12\tTrotsky, pp. 126\u009727.\n13\tAt a mass meeting in Madrid, anarchist leader Federica Montseny criticized Franco\u0092s forces, saying: \"If they were Spaniards, if they were patriots, they would not have let loose on Spain the Regulars and the Moors to impose the civilization of the Fascists, not as a Christian civilization, but as a Moorish civilization.

As the promise of workers\u0092 revolution was being dashed by the rise of fascism in Germany and the rise of Stalinism in the Soviet Union, the workers of Spain led a heroic fight against the 1936 uprising of General Francisco Franco. In the process, they led not only a struggle against fascism, but also a workers\u0092 rebellion that gave the world an inspiring glimpse of what workers\u0092 power could look like. The Spanish Civil War was also the high point of anarchist influence in the international workers\u0092 movement. On the eve of the civil war, the anarchosyndicalist Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) claimed more than a million members and had as its stated aim the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism. Yet the Spanish anarchist movement failed the test that supposedly formed the heart of its program: the destruction of the state.  The ideas and theories of revolutionaries must ultimately be tested by events. During the war, anarchism\u0092s ideological abhorrence of state power\u0096whether that state was a capitalist or a workers\u0092 state\u0096led them, in practice, away from the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism and toward collaboration with the very government they opposed. As Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky wrote at the time, \"In opposing the goal, the conquest of power, the Anarchists could not in the end fail to oppose the means, the revolution.\"1 Anarchism and the rise of the Spanish working class Spain entered the 20th century as one of the most backward countries in Europe. An aged, decrepit monarchy ruled the country, propped up by the twin pillars of the Catholic church and an aristocratic officer corps. Throughout the 19th century, peasant rebellions and military coups had broken out regularly, but none had shaken the hold of the aristocracy. The Spanish bourgeoisie, from its inception, was incapable of leading a determined struggle against the monarchy.  As Trotsky wrote: Now even less than in the 19th century can the Spanish bourgeoisie lay claim to that historic role which the British and French bourgeoisie once played. Appearing too late, dependent on foreign capital, the big industrial bourgeoisie of Spain, which has dug like a leech into the body of the people, is incapable of coming forward as the leader of the people, is incapable of coming forward as the leader of the \"nation\" against the old estates, even for a brief period. The magnates of Spanish industry face the people hostilely, forming a most reactionary bloc of bankers, industrialists, large landowners, the monarchy, and its generals and officials, all devouring each other in internal antagonisms.2 Lacking reliable support from the propertied classes, the monarchy turned time and again to the military. The succession of juntas and palace coups that dotted Spanish history was but an expression of the inability of the Spanish bourgeoisie to lead the struggle for even the most basic democratic rights. But a new class was emerging in Spain that began to change this equation. Spain experienced a period of rapid industrialization during the First World War that led to the growth of a powerful and highly concentrated urban working class. Although Spain remained a predominantly rural country, the working class doubled in size between 1910 and 1930. \"The question of whether the present revolutionary convulsions can produce a genuine revolution, capable of reconstructing the very basis of national life,\" Trotsky continued, \"is consequently reduced to whether the Spanish proletariat is capable of taking the leadership of national life into its own hands.\"3 Anarchism took hold in Spain beginning in the late 19th century among middle-class republican students and professionals who were distrustful of the powerful and corrupt central government; artisan workers who were being displaced by more modern production methods; and southern peasants who had a strong tradition of communalism and a distrust of both government and urban society.4 By the turn of the last century, hundreds of anarchist affinity groups\u0096small groups of 10 to 12 people with similar political ideas\u0096dotted the countryside. Politically these groups covered a wide spectrum. Some groups sought to escape from the existing capitalist system by forming alternative lifestyle communes in the countryside. Some adopted an emphasis on action as a form of propaganda meant to spark wider revolt\u0096\"propaganda of the deed,\" as it was called. This could mean anything from individual acts of terrorism to organizing small, local insurrections. The purpose of these actions was to offer \"a sort of revolutionary \u0091education\u0092 of the masses through acts of revolt.\"5 And still others helped to form militant trade unions, particularly among the peasants of Andalusia and later Arag\u00f3n. Spanish anarchism emerged as an awkward combination of peasant communalism, petty-bourgeois individualism, direct action against the state, and radical trade unionism. Yet they shared in common the basic principles of anarchism: opposition to elections and parliamentary activity, and opposition to all forms of hierarchy and centralism. Many workers, even at the time of the civil war, were at most one generation removed from the countryside. These young workers brought with them a peasant anarchist tradition, and the grueling work and living conditions of urban life proved a fertile ground for the growth of a radical labor movement.  Individualist and terrorist currents remained part of the Spanish anarchist movement. As late as 1936, the CNT devoted an entire discussion at its national congress to the place of vegetarians, nudists, naturists, and \"opponents of industrial technology\" in a libertarian communist society. But the growing ferment among Spanish workers greatly strengthened the position of the anarchosyndicalists, who, like other anarchists, rejected all forms of authority and political action, but who looked to the power of the working class, organized through trade unions, as the force capable of overthrowing capitalism. In November 1910, representatives from anarchosyndicalist unions across Spain met in Barcelona to found the CNT, a national union. As Vernon Richards describes: By its constitution the CNT was independent of all the political parties in Spain, and abstained from taking part in parliamentary and other elections. Its objectives were to bring together the exploited masses in the struggle for day-to-day improvements of working and economic conditions and for the revolutionary destruction of capitalism and the state. Its ends were Libertarian Communism, a social system based on the free commune federated at local, regional and national levels. Complete autonomy was the basis of this federation, the only ties with the whole being the agreements of a general nature adopted by Ordinary or Extraordinary National Congresses.6 While the militant \u00e9lan of the CNT led to successful strikes, this penchant for loose organization and lack of centralized coordination, in the words of Murray Bookchin, a sympathetic chronicler, often led to \"sporadic, ill-time outbursts, easily crushed by the government.\"7 The anarchist revolutionaries in the CNT formed the Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista Ib\u00e9rica (FAI) in 1927, to guard against reformism within the CNT, as well as to maintain its opposition to any \"infiltration\" by other political forces. FAI militants, for example, were instrumental in winning the expulsion in 1931 of a group of 30 CNT leaders, the treintistas, who sought to make the CNT more syndicalist and less anarchist, criticizing the CNT for allowing small groups of militants to substitute their own armed actions for mass struggle. \"The revolution,\" the treintistas wrote, \"does not trust exclusively in the audacity of a more or less courageous minority, but instead it seeks to be a movement of the whole working class marching towards its final liberation.\"8 At the same time, the CNT often viewed workers who were not members as traitors to the revolution. At the 1919 national congress, the CNT leadership passed a resolution giving the workers of Spain a period of three months in which to enter the CNT, failing which they would be denounced as scabs.9 This was not an insignificant statement\u0096it reflected a tendency to see the key divide in society as one not between workers and bosses, but between authoritarians and nonauthoritarians. Although the CNT gained a substantial following among many of the newly arrived workers in Catalonia and the agricultural laborers of Arag\u00f3n by leading a number of militant strikes following the First World War, the Socialist-controlled Uni\u00f3n General del Trabajadores (UGT), with half a million members, was still the largest union in the country. Although the UGT was weighted down with a conservative leadership, any successful workers\u0092 movement\u0096let alone a successful workers\u0092 revolution\u0096would have to include the UGT\u0092s rank and file. The birth of the Republic Faced with growing opposition from Spanish workers after the First World War, the Spanish ruling class fell back on its traditional crutch, the military. In 1923, General Miguel Primo de Rivera took power under a military dictatorship. Even Primo de Rivera\u0092s dictatorship, however, could not ensure order against the growing tide of struggle. When the Great Depression broke out in 1929, Spain fell into a severe economic crisis, and the ruling class found that it could no longer contain the growing anger with brute force. In 1930, Primo de Rivera was forced to resign. King Alfonso XIII called for democratic elections, ushering in the First Republic and five years of social unrest, during which the political right and left vied for control. Elections held in April 1931 went overwhelmingly to the republican parties, forcing King Alfonso to abdicate the throne and flee the country. The government of the Second Republic (the First Republic, formed in 1873, lasted only a year), led by Manuel Aza\u00f1a, was composed of a coalition of the middle-class republican parties and the right wing of the Spanish Socialist Party, the Partido Socialista Obrero Espa\u00f1ol (PSOE). The PSOE provided a left-wing cover for a strictly bourgeois government that, from the outset, showed little interest in pursuing all but the most innocuous reforms. Land reform was perhaps the most pressing issue in all of Spain. Agricultural products accounted for half of the country\u0092s income and two-thirds of its exports. Seventy percent of Spain\u0092s population worked the land, yet a small class of landowners controlled two-thirds of all the country\u0092s arable land, most of it held in large estates. Of the 5 million peasants in Spain, 1.5 million lived as sharecroppers and another 1.5 million were landless workers.10 Starvation and hunger for the Spanish peasantry were as routine as the planting and harvesting of crops. The immediate solution was the confiscation of the large estates and the redistribution of land to millions of poor peasants, but this reform went to the heart of Spanish capitalism. Land in Spain was mortgaged and heavily indebted to Spanish banks. Any expropriation of the large estates threatened not only the large landowners; it would wipe out loans owed to the banks, crippling Spanish capital. So the government stalled. It passed agricultural reforms that provided landowners compensation for any re-divided land. By the government\u0092s own figures, this redistribution would take more than 100 years.11 The republican-Socialist coalition also faced nationalist opposition from Catalan and Basque minorities within Spain and maintained a tenuous hold on a large portion of Morocco, which had been seized by the monarchy in a brutal imperial war that had lasted from 1912 to 1926. The national question was not simply a matter of justice for oppressed minorities; it was a matter of survival for the Republic. The colonial garrisons in Morocco were the most reactionary, brutal sections of the armed forces. The Spanish Foreign Legion and local mercenary groups that had carried out a war of attrition against the Moroccan people were a breeding ground for monarchist and fascist ideas. Any attack on the Republic would likely come from those sections of the armed forces. But the republican government would not give up its colonial possessions; it had its own imperial ambitions.  In less than two months, the republican-Socialist coalition traded its first blows with the workers\u0092 movement. In May 1931, members of the Civil Guard shot 10 workers after a clash with monarchist groups. In July, a general strike broke out in Seville in support of a walkout by local telephone workers. The government declared martial law. Forty workers died and more than 200 were wounded in the ensuing street battles. The republican government was paralyzed between the aspirations of the workers and peasants who had elected it into power and its continued defense of the bourgeoisie. It was incapable of carrying through even the most basic democratic reforms. Reforms could only be defended and extended by strengthening the power of working-class organizations. Only by calling into question the very existence of the bourgeois government could the workers\u0092 movement be strengthened. As Trotsky wrote prophetically in 1931: The Madrid government...promises strong measures against unemployment and land-hunger, but it does not dare to touch a single one of the social ulcers.... The discordance between the progress of the mass revolution and the policy of the new ruling classes\u0096that is the source of the irreconcilable conflict that, in its future development, will either bury the first revolution or produce a second one.12 The struggle over democratic demands was not simply a fight for a less repressive state; it was at the core of the fight for workers\u0092 power and socialism. The working class, as Trotsky argued, was the only class capable of leading the fight for democratic demands for the peasantry and the oppressed minorities; but, in that fight, it was bound also to fight for its own, socialist aspirations. The anarchists had stood aloof from the democratic struggles for the republic. In Catalonia, a CNT stronghold, and in the Basque provinces, the anarchists did not advocate the right of self-determination, leaving the issue in the hands of the middle-class nationalists. And, while it organized demonstrations against the conscription of Spanish workers to fight in Morocco, it all but ignored that country\u0092s struggle for independence.13 The anarchists\u0092 apoliticism led them to vacillate between complete indifference to the struggles for democratic reforms and wild ultra-leftism when antidemocratic laws were used to repress them. Having played little role in the formation of the Republic, the anarchists then faced its betrayals and repression by leaping into an adventurous cycle of insurrections that paved the way for the return of the right wing. In January 1932, anarchists launched an insurrection in the Catalan mining town of Alto Llobregat. The military suppressed it almost immediately. In January 1933, they initiated a call for an insurrection in support of a strike of railway workers. Sporadic uprisings broke out in Catalonia, Valencia, and parts of Andalusia. They were uniformly crushed almost immediately. The centralized Spanish army had no trouble isolating and defeating each revolt in succession. The insurrections had little active support and were further hampered by the anarchists\u0092 insistence on federalism and autonomy. As C\u00e9sar M. Lorenzo, son of the CNT\u0092s national secretary, describes, the federal structure of the CNT-FAI made it impossible to coordinate actions, even for those who wanted to, among the various sections: Within the CNT everyone had his own opinion, everyone acted according to his own judgment, the leaders were ceaselessly criticized and challenged, the autonomy of the regional federations was inviolable, just as the autonomy of the local federations and unions was inviolable within the regional federations. To get a decision accepted...a militant had to exhaust himself making speeches, personal contacts, moving from place to place. Among the libertarians the ballot was repugnant; the unanimity they sought required interminable debates.14 As Frederick Engels noted of the role of the Bakuninist anarchists in the 1873 insurrection in Spain, Nothing remains of the so-called principles of anarchy, free federation of independent groups, etc., but the boundless, and senseless fragmentation of the revolutionary resources, which enabled the government to conquer one city after another with a handful of soldiers, practically unresisted.15 The insurrections were isolated also by the anarchists\u0092 insistence that anyone who opposed their adventure was on the other side. In a characteristic statement during one of its uprisings in 1933, the FAI declared that \"all those who do not cooperate in the armed insurrection are traitors!\"16 Just a week after the January insurrections, anarchists in the small village of Casas Viejas rose up and seized nearby land, proclaiming a libertarian society. The government ordered the military to restore order. In the fighting, the military killed hundreds, burning some alive. Pictures of the massacre of peasants, armed with hatchets and scythes, by soldiers who were armed with rifles and artillery infuriated the public and helped to seal the fate of the Aza\u00f1a government; but the cycle of insurrections took a heavy toll on the anarchists. Thousands of union militants were arrested. As Murray Bookchin notes in his history of anarchism before the civil war, \"Perhaps the example set by the uprising succeeded in fostering the militancy of the growing left factions in the Socialist Party, but apart from strike actions and terrorism, it completely exhausted the movement.\"17 With the anarchists in retreat and the PSOE discredited for its role in the republican government, the right took the initiative. The right-wing parties began cynically exposing the atrocities of the Casas Viejas massacre in their press, and even formed their own tribunals to examine abuses by the military. All of this was a self-serving attempt to embarrass the Aza\u00f1a government by groups that had nothing but contempt for the peasantry, but in the absence of an alternative from the left, it allowed the right to gain the upper hand. The CNT played its part in the elections, arguing, \"Workers! Don\u0092t Vote!... Destroy the ballot boxes...crack the heads of the ballot supervisors as well as the candidates.\"18 When elections were called in November 1933, the right won an overwhelming victory, ushering in what became known as El Bienio Negro, the two black years.  Reaction and revolt The right-wing government that took power in November 1933, headed by Alejandro Lerroux, did so against the backdrop of the rise of fascism in Europe. Hitler had been appointed chancellor of Germany in January by the conservative president Hindenburg. In March, the Austrian fascist, Englebert Dolfuss, had convinced the Austrian president to cede him dictatorial powers. Austrian workers rose up heroically to defeat Dolfuss, but were crushed. Many Spanish workers feared that Spain would be next. After the November elections, the largest number of seats in the Cortes was held by members of the Confederaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Derechas Aut\u00f3nomas (CEDA), a confederation of industrialists, monarchists, and admirers of Mussolini and Dolfuss, led by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gil Robles.  The membership of the PSOE and UGT, radicalized by the failure of the German Social-Democrats to put up any resistance to the rise of fascism and by the Austrian workers\u0092 fierce resistance, put pressure on their leadership to prevent any attempt by Gil Robles to take power. Moderate PSOE leaders Indalecio Prieto and Roman Gonz\u00e1les Pe\u00f1a publicly pledged in the Cortes that any attempt to install a fascist regime would be met with armed revolution. The large left wing, led by the Socialist Youth, declared that they were preparing for a proletarian revolution.19 A call went out for the formation of a broad united front of workers\u0092 organizations, known as the Alianza Obrera, to resist the advance of the right. On October 1, members of CEDA demanded seats in the government, leading to the collapse of the Lerroux government. Lerroux formed a new cabinet that included four members of CEDA. The PSOE leadership, which only months before had promised armed resistance to Gil Robles, was now forced act. On October 4, the Alianza Obrera and the UGT called a nationwide general strike. In most places the strike was a tragic failure. The reformist PSOE leadership that had called for the strike had only partially committed to it. The start of the strike was postponed twice in hopes that an agreement could be reached with Lerroux to remove CEDA from the cabinet. When the UGT finally issued a strike call, it was on short notice and following a declaration of martial law that enabled the government to arrest hundred of Socialist organizers. Only in the mining center of Asturias did the strike take on truly revolutionary proportions. There, the UGT, Communists, and the CNT had all entered into the Alianza Obrera, signing a pact that committed them to work together \"until they obtain a social revolution in Spain.\" On the night of October 4, sirens announced the beginning of the strike. Joint militias attacked the barracks of the Civil Guards, disarming them. Miners marched on the capital, Oviedo, liberating towns along the route and gathering forces. When the miners took control of cities, they redistributed land to the peasants and seized the mines and factories. When they reached the capital, an armed column of 8,000 miners occupied the city. For 15 days the beleaguered miners of Asturias held out against the troops of the Foreign Legion. In the slaughter that followed, more than 3,000 were killed and thousands more were imprisoned.20 The various workers\u0092 organizations had joined spontaneously in Asturias. The October rebellion showed the potential of a united workers\u0092 movement and the desire of many rank-and-file workers from all parties for unity. When the CNT national leadership rebuked the local CNT committee for having signed such a pact without their consent, the rank-and-file miners responded, \"In social struggles, as in other wars, victory always goes to those who previously got together and jointly organized their forces.\"21 Nationally, though, the call for united action through the Alianza Obrera was rejected by the CNT, who opposed the participation of the PSOE.  In response to the call for the Alianza Obrera, the anarchist leader, Buenaventura Durruti, argued, \"The alliance, to be revolutionary, must be genuinely working class. It must be the result of an agreement between the workers\u0092 organizations, and those alone. No party, however socialist it may be, can belong to a workers\u0092 alliance.\"22 Essentially, the CNT\u0092s message was \"We refuse to unite in struggle with workers who have yet to agree to march under our banner.\" An abstract opposition to \"politics\" led the anarchists away from united working-class action.23 The CNT\u0092s hostility to the Socialists was fueled by the opportunism of the PSOE. Though rhetorically to the left of other social-democratic parties in Europe, it had long since abandoned revolutionary politics. The leadership of the PSOE saw the Alianza Obrera as nothing more than a paper alliance. But by dismissing calls for unity and political struggle, the anarchists turned their backs on millions of workers ready to unite in struggle against the right, leaving them under the vacillating leadership of the reformists and centrists of the PSOE. The anarchists\u0092 apolitical radicalism was merely the flip side of the PSOE\u0092s craven opportunism. As the Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin argued in 1917: The professional Cabinet Ministers and parliamentarians, the traitors to the proletariat and the \"practical\" socialists of our day, have left all criticism of parliament to the anarchists. It is not surprising that the proletariat of the \"advanced\" parliamentary countries, disgusted with such \"socialists\"...has been with increasing frequency giving its sympathies to anarchosyndicalism, in spite of the fact that the latter is merely the twin brother of opportunism.24 For Lerroux\u0092s right-wing coalition, however, the rebellion in Asturias was the beginning of the end. The right had been thoroughly discredited and a new militancy was growing among workers and the peasantry. When new elections were called, few people doubted the outcome. From Popular Front to revolution In February 1936, an electoral alliance between the main parties of the middle-class and the main workers\u0092 parties, known as the Popular Front, came to power in Spain. The CNT and the FAI had declined to join the Popular Front, affirming their opposition to all political action. But in practice, the CNT-FAI dropped its abstentionism and gave tacit approval to its members to vote for the Popular Front, thereby assuring its narrow victory. The Popular Front came to power on the heels of a massive wave of strikes and peasant rebellions. Although its program consisted of reforms specifically designed not to alienate the bourgeoisie, most workers and peasants saw the victory of the Popular Front as the beginning of larger battles. As one Madrid socialist put it: [The workers] wanted to go forward, they weren\u0092t satisfied simply with the release of political prisoners and the return to their jobs of all those who had been sacked as a result of the revolutionary insurrection of October 1934. Instinctively, they were pressing forward, not necessarily to take power, not to create soviets, but to push forward the revolution which had begun with the republic\u0092s proclamation.25 The ruling class saw the Popular Front victory as a declaration of war. Lerroux\u0092s right-wing coalition had been unable to restrain the workers\u0092 movement; now large sections of the ruling class dropped their half-hearted support for the Republic and swung behind a dictatorial solution. Soon after the elections, a motley coalition of high-ranking army officers, monarchists, and fascists began plotting a military coup. On the morning of July 17, the army garrison in Spanish-held Morocco rose in revolt under the direction of General Francisco Franco. Garrisons revolted in most major cities. From the beginning it was clear that this was an attack not only on the Popular Front government, but also on the working-class organizations that had brought it to power. After seizing control of the Seville garrison on July 17, General Gonzalo Queipo de Llano signed a proclamation declaring that the leaders of any labor union on strike would \"immediately be shot\" as well as \"an equal number of members selected discretionally.\"26 The Popular Front government received word of the uprising within hours, but kept silent for an entire day. Even on the afternoon of July 18, the government offered only a note that read, \"The Government speaks again in order to confirm the absolute tranquility of the whole Peninsula.\" Instead, on the night of July 18, the government dissolved itself and formed a new cabinet of right-wing politicians outside the Popular Front. Rather than fight the fascists, the government\u0092s first reaction was to appease them. The workers, however, responded immediately. It was a pattern that would be repeated throughout the war. The Popular Front government stalled and prevaricated, hoping until the last moment to avoid confrontation, and the working class led the struggle against the fascists.  The CNT and the UGT demanded that the Popular Front government arm the workers, but it refused. Ignoring the government\u0092s pleas, detachments of workers stormed army barracks, seized weapons and began distributing them to anyone with a trade union or party membership card. They quickly organized defenses, creating armed patrols, arresting fascist sympathizers, and building barricades. Within days, the revolt was defeated in many cities and Franco\u0092s forces were being rolled back out of the province of Arag\u00f3n. But wherever the Popular Front government successfully prevented workers from mobilizing, the rebellion succeeded. Writes historian Hugh Thomas: Nearly everywhere on July 18, the civil governors followed the example of the government of Madrid, and refused to cooperate with the working-class organizations who were clamoring for arms. In many cases, this brought the success of the risings and signed the death warrants of the civil governors themselves, along with local working-class leaders.27 Historians Brou\u00e9 and Tem\u00edme write: In effect, each time that the workers\u0092 organizations allowed themselves to be paralyzed by their anxiety to respect Republican legality and each time that their leaders were satisfied with what was said by the officers, the latter prevailed. On the other hand, the Movimiento was repulsed whenever the workers had time to arm and whenever they set about the destruction of the army as such, independently of their leaders\u0092 positions or the attitude of \"legitimate\" public authorities.28 Although the Popular Front government remained in power, the state apparatus it depended on had collapsed. Most army officers were sympathetic to Franco, and the soldiers had either joined the uprising or the workers\u0092 resistance. Many industrialists and landowners fled to rebel-held territory. As the old society began to fall apart, the workers\u0092 movement organized new structures in its place. The trade unions commandeered cars and trucks to transport members of the newly formed workers\u0092 militias; they formed ambulance services and worker-run hospitals. Communal kitchens and transportation centers were organized.29 In the cities, workers took over factories and placed them under workers\u0092 control. They elected representatives to oversee production and coordinate work in the shops. George Orwell, who arrived in Barcelona six months after the uprising, wrote a moving description of the city under workers\u0092 control in his book Homage to Catalonia: It was the first time that I had ever been in a town where the working class was in the saddle. Practically every building of any size had been seized by the workers and was draped with red flags or with the red and black flag of the Anarchists; every wall was scrawled with the hammer and sickle and with the initials of the revolutionary parties.... Every shop and caf\u00e9 had an inscription saying that it had been collectivized; even the bootblacks had been collectivized and their boxes painted red and black. Waiters and shop-walkers looked you in the face and treated you as an equal....  The revolutionary posters were everywhere, flaming from the walls in clean reds and blues that made the few remaining wall advertisements look like daubs of mud. Down the Ramblas, the wide central artery of the town, were crowds of people streaming constantly to and fro, the loud-speakers were bellowing revolutionary songs all day and far into the night.... There was much in it that I did not understand, in some ways I did not even like it, but I recognized it immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for.30 In the countryside, peasants took control of the land, redistributing large estates and, in many places, collectivizing the land and setting up communes. An anarchist in the town of Membrilla, described their local commune: On July 22, the big landowners were expropriated, small property was liquidated, and all the land passed into the hands of the commune....  The local treasury was empty. Among private individuals the sum of thirty thousand pesetas in all was found and seized. All the food, the clothing, the tools, etc., were distributed equitably along the population. Money was abolished, labor was collectivized, property was taken over by the community, and the distribution of consumer goods was socialized....  Three liters of wine are distributed to every person per week. Rent, electricity, water, medical attention and medicines are free.31 War and revolution From the beginning, the republican parties had nothing but contempt for the revolution: \"The Revolution commenced under a republican government that neither wished to support it nor could support it.\"32 But by 1936, the republican parties had little mass support. They held on to power largely through the support they received from the left. As it had during the first period of the republic, the leadership of the PSOE continued to defend the republican parties. Now the Spanish Communist Party (PCE) joined them. Before the civil war, the PCE had been an insignificant party. It had failed to gain a large following after its founding in 1921, and since Stalin\u0092s rise to power in Russia, it had abandoned any commitment to revolutionary struggle and become little more than a tool of Soviet foreign policy. Now, after a brief period of ultra-leftism in the early 1930s, in which it refused to work jointly with reformist workers\u0092 organizations, the PCE flipped over to become the leading advocate of the Popular Front. The PCE hoped to win the support of the Allies to join a coalition against fascism at a time when the Soviet Union was facing increasing hostility from the Nazi government in Germany.  From the first days of the war, the Popular Front government, with the support of the PSOE and the PCE, passed restrictions on the ability of peasants to seize large land holdings and on workers\u0092 ability to run factories under workers\u0092 control. It passed laws stating that under no condition would the private property of foreign firms be seized. Only by restraining the demands of the workers and peasants, the Popular Front government and its supporters argued, could it maintain unity between all antifascist forces, including the bourgeoisie. Jos\u00e9 Diaz, leader of the PCE wrote: If in the beginning the various premature attempts at \"socialization\" and \"collectivization\"...might have been justified...at the present time, when there is a government of the Popular Front, in which all the forces engaged in the fight against fascism are represented, such things are not only not desirable, but absolutely impermissible.33 Thus the left became the last defenders of the bourgeois order. Both the PCE and the PSOE tried to underwrite their alliance with bourgeois forces by arguing that Spain needed first to have a bourgeois revolution, and only after this could it have a workers\u0092 revolution. But the bourgeoisie and much of the armed forces saw Franco\u0092s rebellion as the only force capable of restoring order and protecting capitalism against the advances of the workers and peasants. Each attempt to appease the bourgeoisie by suppressing the class struggle and the peasants\u0092 fight for land weakened the fight against fascism. Only by strengthening the organizations of workers and peasants, and only by offering a political program based upon land redistribution and workers\u0092 power, could the loyalist side hope to overcome the fascists. Not unity with the bourgeoisie, but a sharp break with the bourgeoisie (which had, after all, tried to prevent workers from taking up arms against the fascists) was necessary to defeat Franco. As Trotsky wrote at the time: A civil war is waged, as everyone knows, not only with military but also with political weapons. From a purely military point of view, the Spanish revolution is much weaker than its enemy. Its strength lies in its ability to rouse the great masses to action. It can even take away the army from its reactionary officers. To accomplish this, it is only necessary to seriously and courageously advance the program of the socialist revolution.34 An immediate redistribution of the large landed estates would have won the support of millions of peasants to the government, including many conservative peasants who had joined the clerical and monarchist forces in Franco\u0092s army. A declaration of independence for Morocco would have undercut Franco\u0092s support in North Africa, and even opened up a second front against his forces in Morocco. The immediate nationalization of industry and banking would have prevented the bourgeoisie from sabotaging war production by reopening closed plants and seizing money that could be used to purchase arms. The Popular Front government could not pursue these basic tasks because they threatened the very existence of the bourgeoisie. Only a revolutionary government led by the working class could enact them. The workers controlled the streets and the factories, but that would not continue indefinitely. Either the workers would seize power in a new revolution or Franco and his supporters would crush the  Republic. The failure to seize power The CNT was in control of much of Republican Spain and had power in its hands. In the Catalan capital of Barcelona, the leaders of the CNT-FAI were called into the offices of Luis Companys, head of the regional government. There Companys told them, \"Today you are masters of the city and of Catalonia.... You have conquered and everything is in your power; if you do not need or want me as president of Catalonia, tell me now.\"35 The delegates of the CNT were surprised by this frank admission: \"He saw the situation more clearly than us because he hadn\u0092t been in the thick of the street fighting. One of us replied, \u0091We have come to no decision about this, consequently we cannot give an answer. We would have to return and report to the CNT.\u0092\"36 The choice was posed clearly: Either the CNT would overthrow the old government and establish a revolutionary government in Catalonia, or the Popular Front would remain in power and slowly strangle both the revolution and the fight against Franco. The CNT, however, was not prepared for the choice. On July 23, the Catalan Regional Committee of the CNT-FAI called a meeting to discuss whether to overthrow the Catalan government. Initially, FAI leader Juan Garc\u00eda Oliver, who later entered the national government as minister of justice, argued to \"go for everything,\" overthrow the government and establish libertarian communism. If the government were overthrown, however, it would have to be replaced by a workers\u0092 government led by the CNT-FAI. The anarchists believed any such state would be a dictatorship, a mortal blow to their anti-statist principles. Federica Montseny argued that \"her conscience as an anarchist would not permit her to accept...to go for everything as Garc\u00eda Oliver proposed, because the installation of an anarchist dictatorship, because it was a dictatorship, could never be anarchist.\"37 And Mariano V\u00e1zquez, the regional secretary of the Catalan CNT, opposed \"compromising the Organization [CNT] in dictatorial practices.\"38 Looking back on the decision, FAI leader Diego Abad de Santill\u00e1n wrote: We could have remained alone, imposed our absolute will, declared the Generalidad null and void, and imposed the true power of the people in its place, but we did not believe in dictatorship when it was being exercised against us, and we did not want it when we could exercise it ourselves only at the expense of others. The Generalidad would remain in force with President Companys at its head, and the popular forces would organize themselves into militias to carry on the struggle for the liberation of Spain.39 When the final vote was taken, Garc\u00eda Oliver backed down, and only one delegate voted in favor of overthrowing the government. The CNT announced that it would support Companys remaining as head of the government.  Many anarchists at the time and since have tried to justify\u0096or at least explain\u0096the decision of the CNT to leave the government intact and even offer support. Some maintain that no such decision needed to be made. \"The dilemma of the \u0091Anarchist and Confederal dictatorship\u0092 or \u0091Collaboration and democracy,\u0092\" writes anarchist Vernon Richards, \"existed only for those \u0091influential militants\u0092 of the CNT-FAI who, wrongly interpreting their functions as delegates, took upon themselves the task of directing the popular movement.\"40 For Richards the problem exists only because Garc\u00eda Oliver and others were \"authoritarian\" enough to acknowledge it. But Richards is only sidestepping the problem. A real dilemma did exist for the thousands of anarchists.  Most anarchists cite the war and the necessity of maintaining unity in the fight against fascism as the reason for not overthrowing the state. As Gaston Leval, a French anarchist who fought with the CNT militias, explains: The anarchists, too, faced with the fascist peril, the suppression of free speech and the right to organize, faced with the inevitable persecutions of all those who would not submit to dictatorship, realized that everyone must unite against fascism.41 Here the anarchists are only aping the arguments of the Stalinists, accepting the political and later physical disarming of the Spanish working class for the sake of \"antifascist unity.\"  The Popular Front government had already shown itself unwilling to lead a determined struggle against Franco for fear of alienating the bourgeoisie at home and abroad. A determined struggle against fascism could only be led by the workers; but the state could not be sidestepped. It had to be overturned and replaced with a workers\u0092 government capable of waging the war along revolutionary lines. By renouncing their intention to overturn the bourgeois state, the anarchists merely showed the inability of their theories to provide a way forward. The anarchist movement had always assumed that the social revolution would solve the question of the state. Now, in a revolutionary situation, the anarchists faced a situation of dual power in which either a workers\u0092 state or a bosses\u0092 state was posed sharply. As Leval again explains: At the end of 1936, all those among the anarchists who were preoccupied primarily with the revolutionary question oversimplified and underestimated the political problem. The social revolution would sweep away the entrenched powers and institutions. The political parties would disappear. The parasitic classes, no longer able to count on the support of the state, would disappear. And all that would remain to be done would be to organize the new anarchist society. But the necessity of fighting the war against fascism completely upset these expectations. The state continued to exist.42 The revolutionary Marxist tradition, contrary to the claims of the anarchists, had always maintained the necessity of destroying the bourgeois state. Its opposition to anarchism had always been that immediately following a revolution it is necessary to replace the bourgeois state with a workers\u0092 government capable of suppressing the forces of reaction. As Lenin writes in State and Revolution:  We do not at all disagree with the Anarchists on the question of the abolition of the state as an aim. We maintain that, to achieve this aim, temporary use must be made of the instruments, means and methods of the state power against the exploiters, just as the dictatorship of the oppressed class is temporarily necessary for the annihilation of classes.43 Again and again, the anarchists found themselves in the same dilemma. To overthrow the state meant replacing it with a revolutionary government led by the CNT-FAI. Anarchists rejected this as dictatorship. If the CNT-FAI refused power, the government would remain in the hands of class forces hostile to the revolution and unwilling to continue the revolutionary struggle that had arrested Franco\u0092s advance. Trotsky writes: In and of itself, this self-justification that \"we did not seize power not because we were unable but because we did not wish to, because we were against every kind of dictatorship,\" and the like, contains an irrevocable condemnation of anarchism as an utterly anti-revolutionary doctrine. To renounce the conquest of power is voluntarily to leave the power with those who wield it, the exploiters. The essence of every revolution consisted and consists in putting a new class in power, thus enabling it to realize its own program in life. It is impossible to wage war and to reject victory. It is impossible to lead the masses towards insurrection without preparing for the conquest of power.44 Even the CNT\u0092s enemies saw its failure clearly. Major Frederic Escofet, a moderate Catalan republican, wrote: [The CNT found itself] virtually in control of the streets, the arms and transportation, in other words, with power in its hands; its leaders, who were bold and energetic and experienced fighters, were disoriented. They had no plan, no clear doctrine, no idea what they should do or what they should allow others to do. The CNT concept of libertarian communism was devoid of realism and was silent as to the road it should follow in a revolutionary period.45 From contempt to collaboration In Madrid, the Popular Front government was still in power, but had little support. The republican parties\u0092 base of support, already weak in July, had evaporated after Franco\u0092s initial victories. In an attempt to widen support for the government, President Manuel Aza\u00f1a invited the left Socialist and head of the UGT, Francisco Largo Caballero, to form a new government with Cabellero as prime minister. Caballero was a reformist turned radical who combined fiery speeches in support of the revolution with continued collaboration with the party\u0092s right wing and the Popular Front government. In September, Caballero formed a government composed of the Socialist, Communist, and left Republican parties. But, from the beginning he was insistent that the CNT be included in the government. Claridad, the publication of Caballero\u0092s faction of PSOE, wrote, \"The entry of the representatives of the CNT into the present Council of Ministers would certainly endow the directive organ of the nation with fresh energy and authority, in view of the fact that a considerable segment of the working class, now absent from its deliberations, would feel bound by its measures and its authority.\"46 Initially, the CNT refused Caballero\u0092s offer of a single seat in the cabinet. They hoped that the strength of the militias and the factory committees would be sufficient to defend the revolution. \"The militia committees guarantee the supremacy of the people in arms,\" wrote Abad de Santill\u00e1n.47 But as the Communists and right-wing Socialists began using their control over supply lines to starve the revolutionary organizations of food and arms, the anarchists realized that they could not remain indifferent to the composition of the government. Having renounced the intention of overthrowing the state, the CNT-FAI opted for collaboration with it! When Caballero agreed to give the CNT-FAI four seats in the government, the CNT-FAI accepted.  The CNT-FAI\u0092s decision to join a government, and a capitalist government no less, was a complete betrayal of the stated aims of anarchism and utterly compromised the anarchists. Looking back on the decision, Federica Montseny, then minister of health and social welfare, wrote:  As a consequence, the state recovered the position it had lost, while we revolutionaries, who formed part of the state, helped it to do so. That was why we were brought into the government. Although we did not enter it with that intention, we were in it, and therefore had no alternative but remain imprisoned in the vicious circle.48  The CNT-FAI now joined Caballero and the Communists as the last defenders of the bourgeois order. In the aftermath of the civil war, few anarchists support the CNT\u0092s decision to enter the government. Even at the time, the CNT-FAI received severe criticism from anarchists abroad. But what anarchist critics fail to do is provide any alternative, any way out of the dilemma in which the CNT-FAI found itself. Jos\u00e9 Peirats, who during the civil war had been a leader in the libertarian youth movement and a strident critic of collaboration, describes the paralysis of the opponents of collaboration: At the distance of many years, I think that those of us who opposed consistently the governmentalist thesis could not have offered any other way of resolving the problems of the time than a stoic and heroic gesture. I think, also, that there was an unconfessed complicity in many militants opposed to collaboration, who shouted their holy ire at the same time they allowed it to happen.... They couldn\u0092t offer any solution.49 Anarchist critics are unable to provide a solution because they accept the theoretical underpinnings that led the CNT-FAI leaders away from the seizure of power and toward collaboration. Helmut Ruediger, representative of the International Workingmen\u0092s Association in Barcelona, himself a critic of the CNT, acknowledged the opposition\u0092s dilemma in his response to the criticisms of foreign anarchists such as Emma Goldman:  Those who say that the CNT should have established its own dictatorship in 1936 do not know what they are demanding.... The CNT would have needed a government program, a program for exercising power; [it would have needed] training in the exercise of power, an economic plan centrally directed, and experience in the use of the state apparatus.... The CNT had none of these. Nor do those who believe that the CNT should have implanted its own dictatorship have such a program, either for their own country or for Spain. Do not let us delude ourselves!  Furthermore, had it possessed such a program before July 19, the CNT would not have been the CNT; it would have been a Bolshevik party, and, had it applied such methods to the Revolution, it would have dealt Anarchism a mortal blow.50 The minority of anarchists who rejected collaboration and tried to find a way out of the impasse of anarchism were forced to break with key aspects of anarchist theory and move toward revolutionary Marxism. The Friends of Durruti, formed in March 1937, was a small group of anarchists based in Barcelona who broke with what they called \"apolitical anarchism\": To beat Franco we need to crush the bourgeoisie and its Stalinist and Socialist Allies. The capitalist state must be destroyed totally and there must be installed workers\u0092 power depending on rank-and-file workers\u0092 committees. Apolitical anarchism has failed.51 In response to this call for the overthrow of the Popular Front and its replacement with a revolutionary government, the CNT leadership demanded their expulsion from the union. The defense of Madrid and the rise of the Communists The very week the anarchists joined the government, Caballero showed just how shallow the Popular Front government\u0092s conviction to fight the fascists was. When Franco\u0092s forces moved to within a few miles of the capital, Madrid, rather than again arm the workers and call for a defense of the city, the new government\u0092s first act was to vote unanimously to flee the capital (the anarchist ministers abstained from the vote, but did not publicly criticize the decision), leaving behind virtually no organized defense of the city. Abandoned by the government, the inhabitants of Madrid began scrambling to build defenses. One young man recalled: \"When the government left, we felt betrayed.... Everyone expected the enemy to take the city. But they didn\u0092t. The climate began to change. There were calls everywhere to defend the city. \u0091Better to die than to live on your knees.\u0092\"52 Men, women, and even children hastily gathered arms and set out for the front. The union of streetcar workers began running free shuttles from the working-class quarters to the front. For weeks, workers fought the fascists street by street, house by house, showing incredible heroism. Men and women often went to the front unarmed, waiting to relieve someone or waiting for a comrade to fall in battle so they could take up arms. Revolutionary posters went up around the city that read, \"MADRID WILL BE THE TOMB OF FASCISM! No pasar\u00e1n! [\"They shall not pass!\"] Every house a fortress, every street a trench, every neighborhood a wall of iron and combatants.\"53 After a month of bitter fighting, Franco\u0092s forces began withdrawing from the Madrid suburbs that had been captured at the beginning of November. The Popular Front had won its first significant victory of the war. Victory had come through the tremendous initiatives and sacrifices of the workers of Madrid, but it was the Communist Party that would claim credit. When the Popular Front government had fled Madrid, it had taken with them the leaderships of all the leading political parties and trade unions except the Communists. The organization of the defense of the city was left largely in their hands. After the defense of Madrid, the Communist press printed glowing accounts of how the Communists had saved Madrid, of the heroism of the Communist-controlled International Brigades, and of the support received from the Soviet Union during the defense.  The PCE and its corollary in Catalonia, the Partit Socialista Unificat de Catalunya (PSUC), had grown from insignificant organizations at the outbreak of the civil war to mass organizations that included many heroic workers who gave their lives in Madrid, but these were not revolutionary workers\u0092 parties. The Communists\u0092 principle demands had been the defense of private property and the limiting of the revolution. In 1936, the majority of its members were small landowners, intellectuals, and members of the urban middle class.54 After the defense of Madrid, the Communists used their newfound popularity to begin to take control of the Popular Army and police forces, recruiting or winning support from leading members of the right wing of the PSOE and many of the remaining officer corps. They then took full advantage of their position over the distribution of weapons to withhold ammunition and supplies from the workers\u0092 militias of the CNT and the Partido Obrero de Unificaci\u00f3n Marxista (POUM), a small anti-Stalinist party based mainly in Catalonia. The aim was clear: to starve the revolution. But the Communists could not gain undisputed control of the war without settling scores with the anarchists, the POUM, and the revolutionary workers of Barcelona. Barcelona: The anarchist betrayal Since July, Barcelona and most of the province of Catalonia had been in an uneasy truce. The workers\u0092 organizations, particularly the CNT, controlled most aspects of daily life; but the regional government was slowly disbanding the revolutionary committees and trying to restore \"order.\" The changes bred resentment among most workers in Catalonia, but opposition had been compromised when the CNT and POUM had entered the regional government in September 1936. Instead, anger and frustration built over the winter. George Orwell, on leave from the front, described the changes in the city since his last visit: [Under] the surface-aspect of the town, under the luxury and growing poverty, under the seeming gaiety of the streets with their propaganda-posters, and thronging crowds, there was an unmistakable and horrible feeling of political rivalry and hatred. People of all shades of opinion were saying forebodingly: \"There\u0092s going to be trouble before long.\" The danger was quite simple and intelligible. It was the antagonism between those who wished the revolution to go forward and those who wished to check or prevent it\u0096ultimately, between Anarchists and Communists.55 The inevitable clash finally came on the morning of May 3, when three truckloads of Assault Guards, under the personal command of a PSUC minister, arrived at the anarchist-held Telephone Exchange with an eviction notice. This was a test of power. The Telephone Exchange had been seized by the CNT in the first days of fighting in July and had been run under workers\u0092 control ever since. It was widely regarded as the most visible symbol of workers\u0092 power in the city.  The CNT militants inside the building responded to the eviction order with bullets. Within hours, barricades were being erected all over the working-class districts of the city. \"Hundreds of workers armed themselves,\" wrote Augustine Souchy, a well-known German anarchist, \"constructing barricades and disarming the civil guard with their consent. No blood was spilled. The workers were masters of the situation.\"56 From the front, a joint column of CNT-POUM militia began a march on Barcelona to support the uprising. Once the fighting started, two things were clear. First, the spontaneous uprising in Barcelona had the support of the majority of workers in Catalonia. Second, this provocation by the government was intended as an act of war against the revolution. This time there could be no collaboration; either the workers would move forward and overthrow the government, or their defeat would be the beginning of the end for the revolution. There were no guarantees that an uprising in Barcelona would have gained support outside of Catalonia, but a defeat in Barcelona guaranteed the defeat of the revolution. Some workers\u0092 organizations understood the need to take power. The Friends of Durruti argued for the disarming of the military and the disbanding of the Communist Party for organizing against the revolution. They also argued for the overthrow of the government and the formation of a revolutionary junta. Likewise, the small group of Trotskyists in Barcelona published a leaflet calling on workers to form revolutionary councils and for the seizure of power. But both groups were too small to influence events decisively. Leadership of the workers\u0092 movement still lay with the leadership of the CNT-FAI. The Popular Front government appealed to the CNT-FAI, and Montseny and Oliver were dispatched to Barcelona to end the fighting. Over the radio, Oliver and later Montseny appealed to CNT militants to dismantle the barricades and return home. CNT leaders stopped the CNT militia column from continuing its march to Barcelona.57 In disgust, workers burned bundles of CNT newspapers at the barricades. \"I heard some comrades cry with rage over the telephone when they telephoned the [CNT-FAI] committees and the latter told them not to shoot, even though they were being attacked by machine-gun fire,\" wrote Abad de Santill\u00e1n.58 The barricades remained for another five days, but without the support of the CNT-FAI leadership, militants eventually retreated in frustration and disgust. The revolution had been defeated. The months that followed were months of outright reaction. First the POUM and then the anarchists were purged from any position of power by the Communists. Thousands of revolutionaries disappeared into secret prisons to be tortured or killed. In June, POUM leader Andr\u00e9s Nin was kidnapped and executed by the Soviet secret police. Any vestige of revolutionary power\u0096the factory committees, the communes, the Council of Arag\u00f3n, the militias\u0096was forcibly disbanded. The Popular Front government held out for nearly another two years, but from May 1937 on, its fate was sealed. Once the revolution was defeated, the civil war became a strictly military conflict. In a conventional war, the fascists held all the advantages\u0096money, equipment, troops. The tremendous heroism and sacrifice on the part of Spanish workers that had marked the early months of the war had been based on a belief that they were fighting for a new society. With that gone, there was little reason to risk everything. As one peasant soldier fighting on Franco\u0092s side shouted across the trenches to workers\u0092 appealing to him to switch sides, \"What has the republic done for us that we should fight for it?\"59 When Barcelona, the cradle of the revolution, fell to Franco on January 26, 1938, there were no barricades, there was no heroic defense. Manuel Tag\u00fce\u00f1a, the Communist Commander of the 15th Army Corp wrote, \"Barcelona accepted defeat with sorrow and saw no purpose at all in prolonging the fight. We were no longer in 1936.\"60 Conclusion The apoliticism of the anarchist movement, its \"denial\" of political struggle, left it to drift between extreme militancy and collaboration. Responsibility for the defeat of the revolution must ultimately lie with Franco\u0092s army, the complicity of the PSOE leadership, and the treachery of the Communists\u0096but it also lay in the betrayal of the revolution by the anarchist leaders. The failure of the CNT-FAI to take power and its subsequent collaboration was not in spite of its anarchist principles; it was a product of them. By rejecting the formation of a workers\u0092 government as a form of dictatorship and refusing to seize power, the CNT-FAI left itself no course but that of collaboration, covered up with phrases borrowed from the Stalinists about the need for \"antifascist unity.\" As Trotsky noted somewhat humorously at the time: We have already heard from some Anarchist theoreticians that at the time of such \"exceptional\" circumstances as war and revolution, it is necessary to renounce the principles of one\u0092s own program. Such revolutionists bear a close resemblance to raincoats that leak only when it rains, i.e., in \"exceptional\" circumstances, but during dry weather they remain waterproof with complete success.61 The anarchists thus vacillated between ultra-left adventurism (the period of the insurrections and a complete rejection of politics) and complete accommodation (joining a bourgeois government) at the decisive revolutionary moment. An alternative is necessary not as a historical exercise, but because it shapes the struggles of today. In trying to explain the failures of the CNT in the Spanish Revolution, some anarchists have taken exactly the wrong lessons and retreated from the very idea of class struggle altogether. Murray Bookchin writes that as a result of the failure of the Spanish Revolution The limitations of the trade union movement, even in its anarchosyndicalist form, have become manifestly clear. To see in trade unions (whether syndicalist or not) an inherent potentiality for revolutionary struggle is to assume that the interests of workers and capitalists, merely as classes, are intrinsically incompatible. This is demonstrably untrue if one is willing to acknowledge the obvious capacity of the system to remake or to literally create the worker in the image of a repressive industrial culture and rationality.62 An inability to provide an alternative to the policies of the CNT-FAI has led Bookchin and others away from the idea that workers can struggle to remake the world in a more equal and democratic image. Today the anarchist movement is a far cry from the tradition of the CNT. It is dominated by middle-class, lifestyle politics, often explicitly rejecting workers\u0092 struggle as a means of liberating society. Yet this is the greatest legacy of the Spanish Revolution. Whatever its failures, it stands as a heroic example of workers\u0092 struggle. Whatever its flaws, it gives a glimpse of what a socialist world could look like. But that alone is insufficient. While revolutionary socialists and anarchists share a common goal in a classless society, ultimately an alternative to capitalism must be found not within the tradition of Bakunin, Kropotkin, and Goldman, but with the revolutionary socialist tradition of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Trotsky. 1\tLeon Trotsky, The Spanish Revolution, 1931\u00971939 (New York: Pathfinder Press, 1973), p. 316. 2\tTrotsky, p. 24. 3\tTrotsky, p. 24. 4\tMurray Bookchin, The Spanish Anarchists: The Heroic Years, 1868\u00971936 (San Francisco: AK Press, 1998), pp. 61\u009763; Juan G\u00f3mez Casas, Anarchist Organization: The History of the FAI (Montreal: Black Rose Books, 1986), pp. 26\u009727.  5\tMax Nomad, quoted in Bookchin, p. 116. 6\tVernon Richards, The Lessons of the Spanish Revolution (London: Freedom Press, 1995), p. 17. 7\tBookchin, p. 162. 8\tQuoted in Hugh Thomas, The Spanish Civil War (London: Pelican, 1986), pp. 73\u009774. 9\tBurnett Bolloten, The Spanish Civil War: Revolution and Counterrevolution (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1991), p. 197 10\tFelix Morrow, Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Spain (New York: Pathfinder, 1974), p. 8. 11\tMorrow, p. 10. 12\tTrotsky, pp. 126\u009727. 13\tAt a mass meeting in Madrid, anarchist leader Federica Montseny criticized Franco\u0092s forces, saying: \"If they were Spaniards, if they were patriots, they would not have let loose on Spain the Regulars and the Moors to impose the civilization of the Fascists, not as a Christian civilization, but as a Moorish civilization.

Rain threatened, I needed coffee, probably a shower, but it didn\u2019t matter. If the heavens opened up and the Leaf ran out of juice, I would have happily jogged the rest of the way in the rain with a giant smile on my face, because I had a date with the future. Let\u2019s rewind a bit, and see how I got here\u2026 My first car was a brand new 1994 Honda Civic. Bought it new right after college, drove it for 140,000 mostly-uneventful miles, and finally sold it on the opposite coast. My next car, purchased on eBay during a quarter-life crisis, was a silver 2002 Audi TT Roadster. I put a subwoofer in the trunk, won (back) the girl of my dreams, then promptly sold it and moved to Hawaii. Pretty standard stuff. Here, practicality won again and I went for a heavily-used 2007 Toyota Camry. It was beige. Doug backed it into a fence, my mom smashed a taillight, and roaches considered it a Four Seasons. It did its job without complaint. Then along came the Nissan Leaf. I\u2019d been eyeing electric cars for a while, but the Leaf was clearly on new ground in terms of price and almost 100 miles of range (which on Maui brings you to surf, poke and groceries). Federal and state rebates put it at just over $200\/month to lease, so I jumped. Friends teased me about the \u201cgolf cart\u201d, and it definitely didn\u2019t exude style, but it was hella practical and I loved it, enough to lease two in a row for 5 years and swear I\u2019d never own a gas car again. Of course, you can\u2019t drive an electric car without being aware of Tesla. I did my best to ignore the Model S because I couldn\u2019t afford it and I figured the more I knew, the more I\u2019d want one anyway. I even went out of my way to avoid riding in one. To this day I\u2019ve only been in one, a random Uber hailed in Colorado driven by a kind, bored, semi-retired gentleman. I tried my best to just look out the window and not notice I was in a fucking spaceship from the future, because otherwise I\u2019d start selling my kidneys. But then came the Model 3: The Volks-Tesla, fit for every family. So I plunked down $1000. Being only a few months into a 3-year Leaf lease, I was in no great hurry, and thankfully so, because it was a long wait\u2026 About 22 months after making the reservation, I got notice that it was time to configure the vehicle. The online experience was quick and smooth; I think it was clever of Tesla to offer only the longer range car at first. Even though I clearly had no practical need for the extra 100 miles, I didn\u2019t think twice. The premium package was required for these earlier builds as well, but I had wanted it for the improved audio and the glass roof. Silver metallic, stiletto wheels, Enhanced Autopilot, and done. All I had to show for it was an image to gaze upon lovingly that I saved to my desktop. Delivery would supposedly happen in 4\u20136 weeks, but who knew how much longer it would take in Hawaii. One year and 364 days after reserving, I drove up to Maui\u2019s King Kamehameha Golf Club in my dirty Leaf, A\/C off to save on battery. I\u2019d read online something about elaborate ceremonies, but (sensing a theme?) I tried my best to know as little as possible. It was a dark grey day, and the club was eerily empty. In front of the majestic Frank Lloyd Wright building were parked 4 brand new Teslas in pure Fast and the Furious style. The juxtaposition of Wright\u2019s organic architecture against the curves of the gleaming Teslas with storm clouds as backdrop, was stunning. A Tesla employee wandered busily from car to car with a chamois cloth removing droplets of water and stray molecules of dust. I met the delivery specialist at the door, and we sat in the spacious lobby to sign a few (dozen) pieces of paper. I\u2019d opted for financing through Tesla, and that made everything straightforward. There was no actual ceremony to speak of, but the pent-up excitement over two years more than made up for it. After signing, we went and sat in the car and he showed me the basic setup, gave me his phone number, and left me to sit in silence for a few minutes. I\u2019d read online about people with panel misalignments and all sorts of other little things, and I actually had a checklist on my phone, but I decided to just look it over quickly and not obsess over things I wouldn\u2019t ever notice in normal use. The car looked perfect. Anna (my wife) mocked me endlessly for reading the Model 3 manual multiple times before picking up the car, but that did little to prepare me for the strong emotions I experienced in those first few minutes. The best comparison I can make is when a decade earlier I\u2019d moved from flip phone to the iPhone: ground-breaking user-focused design, and the feeling that every other car would now feel outdated, of a past era. I got up the courage to inch the car along the driveway a bit; adjusted the mirrors a little more; and then off I drove\u2026 As you can probably tell, I\u2019m not a car guy, so I don\u2019t care about 0\u201360 numbers, but holy shit this car has incredible acceleration; it\u2019s fast, nimble, and so fun to drive. My TT Roadster with its laggy turbo would get smoked by the instant torque the Tesla delivers. The Leaf feels like an adorable blob of jello by comparison. I still can\u2019t fathom why you\u2019d would want the higher-powered Ludicrous mode unless you were planning an actual bank heist and had a baby-faced getaway driver. I love the single screen and the clean wood panel running across the front, and don\u2019t miss having the traditional display at all. The increased vertical field of view is a huge improvement. Why does one need RPMs, battery voltage, temperature, or fuel gauge constantly cluttering the visual field? Bygone relics, living on design inertia. All the glass makes for excellent visibility, especially with the glass roof. When you look over your right shoulder, it\u2019s like looking out of a modern house with large windows as opposed to peeking out of little portholes as many cars feel like. I went back and counted over 50 controls in the front of the Leaf (dials, knobs, switches). The fact that they\u2019ve all been replaced with on-screen controls is almost universally a great thing. More on that later. The screen itself is bright, and the user interface is modern, clean and responsive. Compared to my Leaf and its ancient-feeling, clunky resistive-touch display and user interface designed by underground troglodytes, it\u2019s literally night and day. This is a substantial accomplishment for a \u201ccar company\u201d that the interface looks and feels like a fluid and beautiful artifact from the future. And that\u2019s really just it: Tesla is a design and technology company that happens to make cars. Not unlike Apple, a design and technology company that happened to make a phone. All you get with the Tesla are two slick-looking key cards which look like they get you behind the velvet ropes at a swanky night club, possibly with a bottle of Dom thrown in. It\u2019s easier to throw one in a wallet than carry a key fob, but the vast majority of people will simply pair a smartphone to experience the true bliss of a keyless future. Walk up to any door and it unlocks at your touch; walk away, and the car locks, mirrors cutely folding in to nap more comfortably. I know this isn\u2019t exactly a Tesla innovation (Prii have been doing it for a decade), but it makes a huge difference returning to the car with groceries. Add Apple Pay and you finally have a one-pocket future. I parked at Whole Foods the other day and marvelled that I didn\u2019t need my wallet or keys (N.B. the gray in my beard entitles me to purchase alcohol sans ID. YMMV.) This gets me to configurability. In software the joke is that adding a setting is the worst possible outcome (because it\u2019s the easiest and weakest way to resolve any disagreement about user experience: \u201cHey, let\u2019s have it both ways\u201d) but of course this isn\u2019t universally true. Most cars (large, expensive things we own for years and use very differently) have few configurable bits, which made the Tesla a breath of fresh air. You can configure the unlocking and locking behavior, among many, many other things (e.g. don\u2019t want mirrors folding in automatically? No problem. Prefer one-pedal driving with increased regenerative braking? There\u2019s a knob for that too. Want the mirrors positioned differently when backing up? Yes you can!). You can also have multiple user profiles (with seat and steering wheel settings) and name them, so Anna can tap the screen and pick her wifely profile. Adjust your seat a bit after a large meal? You get a little popup asking if you\u2019d like to save the change to your profile. All these things add up quickly to make all other cars seem antediluvian and\u2014more importantly\u2014to make the Tesla feel more uniquely yours. Great user experience is often subtle. As an example, the car\u2019s Bluetooth pairs much faster and earlier than any other car I\u2019ve ever seen (my Leaf spends 30 seconds connecting and disconnecting before resuming audio; Anna\u2019s car sporadically fails to connect at all). So by the time you\u2019ve opened the door, music is usually playing softly already to welcome you (it turns up the volume once the doors close). Likewise, when you exit the car, the volume automatically fades so the garage doesn\u2019t reverberate with De La Soul. Another nice touch: when you plug the car in, the Tesla logo on the charging cable\u2019s box lights up each letter in sequence as if to show the direction of the current. The main dashboard display turns on to show charge status and time to full charge in large letters, visible at a distance. Last one: when you stop the car and are going to get out, there\u2019s no need to even put it in Park. When you open the door, it just assumes that\u2019s what you meant to do. Subtle, clever, lovely. As most modern cars, the Tesla has HomeLink support to allow opening garage doors and gates. Instead of just offering the standard three buttons I\u2019ve seen on literally every other car, they allow automatic opening and closing via GPS; you can configure the location of the garage door and gate, the distance from the location, and auto-close behavior as well. After getting it set up, I drove home with Anna and she was surprised and delighted to see the gate open as we approached, and then the garage door. Indistinguishable from magic\u2026 I keep wanting to see the car from above, because it looks absolutely futuristic and beautiful with the dark glass roof. These are the hardest things to explain to new passengers. You have to press in with your thumb to make the handle swing out so that you can grab and pull it. It makes sense, after the fact; it\u2019s idiomatic design which is not intuitively obvious. Also in the dark it can be a bit hard to open the door because you have to find the handle by touch alone. Conversely, when opening from the inside, you have to tell people to push a button and then lean against the door. This isn\u2019t difficult (again, idiomatic), but every single person has first ended up stuck outside, and then trapped inside, which is probably a great metaphor for Tesla ownership in general. The car comes with Slacker and TuneIn apps you can use with the built-in LTE connection. This feels light years ahead of other cars, especially with the beautiful large screen to browse on and responsive user interface. I don\u2019t miss CarPlay and Android Auto, personally (in fact, I think they\u2019d look clunky mixed in with the Tesla interface, that\u2019s how good it is), but I do wish Tesla would allow third party apps (we\u2019d love to write a Plex app for it!) or even some sort of limited integration for other music services (again, for Plex). I\u2019m a bit of an audio snob, and the audio quality is quite impressive. Good tight bass, great imaging, clean sound. No complaints with the upgraded audio. I can only imagine they use oxygen-free cables to stop the zeros and ones from leaking out or getting jittery. There\u2019s quite a bit of storage around the cup holders, including a nice angled area which makes for good phone storage. I got on the list for a wireless charging pad. Almost everything else on the car feels and looks high quality, but the cover for the front storage area is one of the few exceptions. It\u2019s plastic, flimsy, a little tricky to close, and generally feels out-of-place. There\u2019s also a small gap between the phone shelf and the compartment that\u2019s swallowed my phone on more than one occasion. In theory, they sound amazing. You simply set them to Automatic, and a neural network uses a camera to watch for rain, engaging them when needed. We\u2019ve had a rainy April here and I\u2019ve been able to test them extensively, and I\u2019m sorry to say, it doesn\u2019t work well at all (it consistently under-wipes, especially in the dark). Exacerbating the issue is the fact that the only way to manually set the speed (besides a one-off wipe with a stalk button) is via the touch-screen. When it\u2019s rainy and you can\u2019t see, the last place you want to be looking is away from the road to try to get the wipers to work. Practically, I usually have it set on Automatic and then supplement wipes by pressing the button. I am hopeful that a software update can remedy the situation (something you wouldn\u2019t say about other cars). There is definitely an outsized emphasis on software with Teslas. We\u2019re seeing this trend in electronics in general, where the software layer is becoming more and more visible and interactive. My washing machine used to just concern itself with getting my clothes clean with a mode dial and a few buttons. Now it has an LCD display, and I\u2019m sure my next one will send me text messages whenever it\u2019s time to move a load into the dryer or it\u2019s feeling lonely. Cars have always had software, but to date it\u2019s been fairly opaque and completely static. The Tesla ushers in an era of a connected, software-powered car which receives software updates a few times a year that adds new features, fixes bugs, and of course\u2014famously\u2014adds new easter eggs. Let it never be said Musk doesn\u2019t have a sense of humor. So software-centric is the Tesla that it sells premium features for the cars which are entirely software (yes, I know it depends on hardware in the cars, but everyone gets that hardware). Autopilot is one example of that. Amazingly, the Model 3 promises that full self-driving capabilities will be available in the future for $3,000, claiming that the car has all the hardware it needs to achieve such a feat. There is some debate over this; some claim that LIDAR is required, and that a vision-and-radar only approach won\u2019t work. I don\u2019t know enough to have a strong opinion, but I do feel very strongly: if Tesla manages to pull this off, and after swiping my credit card online one night, I wake up the next morning with a car which can magically drive itself, that will be the most incredible software upgrade ever in the history of software upgrades. For now, though, it\u2019s a great feeling to know that every month or two, the car will get an update with improvements and some quibbles fixed. The feature I\u2019m most looking forward to? WiFi support for home networks. I don\u2019t get cellular coverage in my garage, so I have to rely on it downloading updates while I\u2019m out and about. It seems like a pretty strange omission given the hardware is there, but hey, it\u2019ll get fixed. I had read quite a bit about Autopilot and watched a few YouTube videos, but even with that preparation, I was blown away by how well it actually works. As a preface, I live on the North shore of Maui, and we don\u2019t have highways to speak of here, just twisty divided roads. Being an engineer, I can\u2019t resist using Autopilot whenever I can engage it (being safe, of course). The performance is really, really good\u2014it\u2019s smooth, neatly follows cars in stop and go traffic, glides to a smooth stop when it needs to, and picks up poorly marked lanes at night and in the rain. The thing I didn\u2019t realize was that even with hands on the wheel and paying attention to the road, having Autopilot engaged reduced the cognitive load of driving, and made me feel safer. Feeling it making slight adjustments to lane position and to speed for the car ahead is a huge help and I missed it when I was dropping off the poor Leaf for good. The closest I\u2019ve personally come to accidents in the last few years was almost rear-ending the car in front of me, and veering into another lane\u2014both scenarios that Autopilot can greatly help with. If I had to make a list of improvements I\u2019d love to see they would be: One last observation: there\u2019s a curve fairly close to my place which drives Autopilot insane every time. It\u2019s a left curve, but the white line on the right curves away to the right as there\u2019s a side street which intersects the main road on the curve. If the car followed the double-yellow line on the left, it would be fine, and I\u2019ve tried it in various conditions. It jerks around a bit trying to decide what to do and then quits Autopilot (\u201cCould use a hand here, human!\u201d). Except for the last time. Nothing else was different, as far as I could tell, but after a bit of hesitation, it stayed on the road correctly. I would love to think that there\u2019s some fairly tight feedback loop in the system where it\u2019s noting where it\u2019s having trouble, and noting what the human does, and \u201clearning\u201d from it. There\u2019s some indication this is happening on a bigger scale with all the driver data Tesla is collecting. but it would be amazing if the loop were tighter. This car is the future. There\u2019s no other way to say it. Tesla has fundamentally altered what a car looks and feels like and how it interacts with the driver. They\u2019ve shattered norms the same way Apple has with products like the iPod and the iPhone. Whether or not Tesla ends up succeeding or not (I suspect it will, based purely on the universal love for their products), we will remember what cars were like \u201cbefore Tesla\u201d. This is an amazing time to be alive as we start the long transition to fully autonomous vehicles, and owning a Model 3 feels like having a literal front row seat to the whole event. (Secretly, I\u2019m pretty sure the Model 3 steering wheel is removable\u2026) By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

Modern and efficient, no rocket launched more than the 70m Falcon 9 booster launched last year. Barring catastrophe, no rocket seems likely to launch more this year. In part, SpaceX has achieved this level of efficiency by bringing a Silicon Valley mindset to the aerospace industry. The company seeks to disrupt, take chances, and, like so many relentless start-up companies, drive employees to work long hours to meet demanding engineering goals. While founder Elon Musk\u2019s ambitions to settle Mars get most of the public\u2019s attention, the company\u2019s workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, which almost never leaves Earth orbit, is the reason SpaceX has soared to date. And on this vehicle, Musk\u2019s company has imprinted its ethos of disruption and innovation by seeking every opportunity to improve the rocket. Although this has caused headaches for customers like NASA and some suppliers, constant tinkering has allowed SpaceX to maximize performance of this rocket. By regularly upgrading the Merlin engines, shedding weight with lighter materials, and using super-chilled rocket fuel to maximize density, the Falcon 9 rocket now is about twice as powerful as it was during its initial flight. Rarely during its more than 50 launches since June 2010 has a Falcon 9 rocket not had a handful or more changes from the previous edition. All the while, SpaceX has had a singular goal for the Falcon 9 rocket: to build the most perfect and efficient orbital rocket it could. Now, finally, the company seems close to taking a final step toward that goal by closing the loop on first-stage reusability. As soon as next Monday, but more likely a bit later this month, SpaceX intends to launch the \u201cBlock 5\u201d variant of the Falcon 9 rocket for the first time. Musk has said this fifth revision of the Falcon 9 should mark the final major change for the booster.The Block 5 rocket (not seen here) will be optimized for landing again, and again, and again.SpaceX The company has a lot riding on the revamped booster. SpaceX intends to fly each Block 5 first stage it builds a minimum of 10 times and\u2014depending on your willingness to accept Musk\u2019s enthusiastic outlook\u2014perhaps many more. Ten flights would be hugely significant, as SpaceX has thus far only ever reused each of its Falcon 9 rockets a single time. Additionally, the company hopes to reduce the turnaround time between launches of a Falcon 9 booster, now several months, to a matter of weeks. Achieving such a nirvana of low-cost, rapid access to space would represent a tremendous feat for SpaceX. For a company that aspires to one day land humans on Mars, this is the essential first step. Moreover, by freezing the design of the Falcon 9 rocket, SpaceX can free up its engineering talent to focus on the \u201cBig Falcon Rocket\u201d and its upper stage spaceship. And by flying each Block 5 booster multiple times, it can release its skilled workers to assemble that much, much larger booster. The upcoming launch of the Block 5 rocket, therefore, marks the end of the beginning for SpaceX. To find a Falcon 9 launch of comparable magnitude to the forthcoming Block 5 launch, one probably has to go back to December 2015. The stakes were incredibly high then, too. Six months before, in June, SpaceX had suffered the first failure of the Falcon 9 booster, a catastrophic break-up of the second stage at about 150 seconds into the flight. The Dragon spacecraft ascending into space, laden with NASA cargo valued at more than $100 million, was lost. SpaceX spent nearly half a year assessing and fixing the problem before returning to the launch pad. For that December flight, SpaceX doubled-down on its philosophy of taking risks. The Falcon 9 booster standing at the pad three days before Christmas was the first one using a much more powerful variant of the rocket, known as the Falcon 9 Full Thrust, or Block 3. This ambitious booster had about 30 percent more capability than its predecessor, with more powerful engines and slightly larger tanks that accommodated super-cooled liquid oxygen and highly refined kerosene. Other modifications included upgraded grid fins to steer the rocket on its return through Earth\u2019s atmosphere and landing legs. But with this return to flight mission, it was not enough to debut an entirely revamped rocket. For the first time, SpaceX would also attempt to return a booster to Earth for a vertical landing along the Florida coast. Always be innovating, pushing. Later that night, after the successful flight and landing, Musk held a teleconference with reporters. Ars asked Musk how confident he had been in success of the mission, both launching the new booster and sticking the landing. \"I wasn't at all confident that we would succeed, but I'm really glad of it,\" he replied. \"It's been 13 years since SpaceX was started. We've had a lot of close calls. I think people here are overjoyed.\" Musk has since told confidants that it was this Block 3 version of the Falcon 9 rocket that put SpaceX on top of the commercial satellite launch competition, elbowing out Russia, China, and Europe\u2019s state-run rocket companies for a lot of this business. The more powerful Block 3 rocket also allowed SpaceX to begin launching heavier payloads for the US military. With Block 3, Musk felt as though he had the best rocket in the world.

(examples: physics, climate change, etc.) Menu label requirements go into effect Monday President Donald Trump has found one part of the federal health law palatable: He\u2019s allowing Obamacare rules that require chain restaurants to post calorie counts to go into effect Monday. The rules, which are among the final pieces of the 2010 Affordable Care Act to be implemented, require restaurants to list calories on all menus and menu boards. Restaurants will also have to provide on-site additional nutritional information, such as fat and sodium levels. The law, intended to nudge Americans to eat healthier, applies to chains with at least 20 stores. And it won\u2019t be just fast-food and sit-down restaurants that are affected. Grocers, convenience stores, movie theaters, pizza delivery companies and even vending machines must meet the new requirements. The menu labeling rules will improve public health, the Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said last week in an interview. He pointed to studies showing that enlightened customers order, on average, up to 50 fewer calories a day. While that equates to the calories in a small cookie, Gottlieb said, the impact compounded over weeks and months can\u00a0deliver a large benefit. \u201cThis is a meaningful, incremental step in addressing\u201d the country\u2019s obesity epidemic, he said. Seeking to alleviate retailers\u2019 concerns, the FDA delayed implementing the rules several times to give the food industry time to comply after finalizing the menu-labeling rule in 2013. The provisions are supported by consumer advocates and the\u00a0National Restaurant Association, which wanted to avoid catering to a hodgepodge of requirements from cities and states. But some food industry groups and retailers say they still don\u2019t have all the answers and worry the rules will place an undue burden on shop owners. The National Association of Convenience Stores expressed reservations about how its members will comply. \u201cConvenience retailers will welcome any flexibility the FDA may be able to provide in order to comply with this onerous rule,\u201d said spokesman Jon Taets. Conservatives in Congress also have repeatedly lashed out at the provisions, with the House passing\u00a0a bill\u00a0earlier this year that would modify them. The Senate has not acted on that legislation. Even as the provisions go into effect, the FDA announced that over the course of the next year officials will seek to educate the industry about meeting the new rules, rather than enforcing them. Many restaurant chains, including McDonald\u2019s, Burger King, Taco Bell and Panera Bread, have listed calorie information for years. But some, including Legal Sea Foods and the Melting Pot, have not yet added the information. Officials for the Melting Pot said they plan to have nutritional information posted by the end of the month. Legal Sea Foods did not return calls for comment. \u201cAmericans deserve to know what they\u2019re getting when ordering for themselves and their families at chain restaurants, supermarkets and other food retailers,\u201d said Margo Wootan, vice president for nutrition for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group.\u00a0\u201cMenu labeling isn\u2019t a silver bullet. It\u2019s just one of dozens of things we should be doing to help Americans maintain a healthy weight and reduce their risk of diet-related health problems like diabetes, heart disease and cancer.\u201d But others see the issue differently. Daren Bakst, a fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the law equates to government overreach. \u201cIt\u2019s not up to the government to influence what people eat \u2014 that should be left up to each individual,\u201d he said. Bakst said he likes having nutritional information on foods he buys but opposes the government mandate for retailers. \u201cPlenty of restaurants will be hurt by compliance costs,\u201d he said. Yet many restaurants say they are ready. \u201cThis date is long overdue,\u201d said Cicely Simpson, an executive vice president at the National Restaurant Association. Most chains don\u2019t see the calorie information postings as hurting overall sales. Yet, she said, the information will lead some consumers to switch the foods they choose. She said the FDA has been flexible with the industry, including efforts to clarify that promotional signs and flyers in stores are not the same as menus and don\u2019t have to include calorie information. Domino\u2019s Pizza spokesman Tim McIntyre said his company has concerns about how its franchises will meet these requirements but is confident the changes won\u2019t increase prices for consumers. The pizza delivery company hopes the FDA will allow it to meet the provisions by posting nutritional information on its website as it has done for years, rather than on menu boards, he said. The company said 90 percent of orders are placed by phone or internet, and with hundreds of pizza combinations and sizes it would be difficult to list nutritional info for each one on a menu. McIntyre said the menu labeling rules were meant to give consumers calorie information at the point where they are ordering. For pizza delivery companies that is rarely inside the store, he noted. \u201cAll we are asking for is common-sense approach to put this information where people are \u2026 and we believe the internet is where people are going to go to get this information,\u201d he said. The FDA has put out thousands of pages of guidance to help restaurants and other food providers comply with the law, such as helping grocery stores decide where to put information on salad bars. Under FDA guidance, if pizza delivery stores don\u2019t have menu boards, they don\u2019t have to add any under the law. Gottlieb said he frequently uses restaurant\u2019s calorie information on signs when ordering food. \u201cI admittedly occasionally go to fast-food restaurants and take into consideration the calories,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to go to McDonald\u2019s time to time to order an Egg McMuffin, but now I go for the Egg White Delight.\u201d According to McDonald\u2019s, an Egg McMuffin packs 300 calories while the Egg White Delight has only 280.

The joke played on the documentation\nfor abort() to make a statement about US government policy on\nproviding information about abortions.  As Nicholson noted: \"The joke\ndoes not provide any useful information about the abort() function so\nremoving it will not hinder use of glibc\".  On April\u00a030, Zack\nWeinberg applied the patch to the glibc\nrepository.\n \nRichard Stallman, who added the joke sometime in the 1990s, asked that it not be removed.  The resulting\ndiscussion touched on a number of issues.  Carlos O'Donell, who has been\ntrying hard to resolve the issue with some degree of consensus, suggested that the joke could hurt people who\nhave had bad experiences associated with abortion.  He proposed a\ncouple of possible alternatives, including avoiding jokes entirely or\ndiscussing such issues in a different forum.  Stallman, however, replied that \"a GNU manual, like a\ncourse in history, is not meant to be a 'safe space'\".  He suggested\nthe possibility of adding a trigger warning about functions that create\nchild processes, since childbirth is \"far more traumatic than having an\nabortion\". \n \nWhether the joke belongs in the glibc manual is an issue for the glibc\ndevelopers to decide and wouldn't normally be of much interest beyond the\nproject itself.  But in this case, it raises the question of how the\ndevelopers make this decision.  The project's wiki\nstates that the project \"uses a consensus-based community-driven\ndevelopment model\".  In this case, there seems to be a fairly clear\nconsensus among the actual glibc developers that this joke is not\nappropriate in the project's manual.  Weinberg's application of the patch\nwas based on this consensus.\n \nStallman, however, has made it clear that there are limits to the extent to\nwhich glibc is consensus-based; his response was: \"My decision is to keep\nthe joke\".  Weinberg stated his\nrefusal to revert the change; Stallman answered: \"I stand by my decision to\nkeep the joke\". O'Donell apologized\nfor not contacting Stallman directly about the removal, but also stood by\nthe decision to remove it.  He asked:\n \n \nWeinberg defended his application of the\npatch:\n \n \nStallman was unimpressed, though, and fell back to a pure authority play,\nsaying: \"As the head of the GNU\nProject, I am in charge of what we publish in GNU manuals.  I decide the\ncriteria to decide by, too\".  He later added:\n \n \nO'Donell repeated that a discussion was\nunderway and that the maintainers did not intend to revert the patch.  He\nalso asked whether the change violated any GNU policies \u2014 a question that\nwent unanswered as of this writing.  He also stated clearly that the joke would not return\nin any form until some sort of consensus was reached.\n \nOne could argue that the consensus is already there if one looks at the\ndevelopers who actually work on glibc; it is difficult to find any of them\narguing for the joke's return.  The number of people arguing for the joke\nin general is quite small.  That did not stop Alexandre Oliva, who\nevidently has a high opinion of Stallman's\nsense of humor, from reverting\nthe change early on May\u00a07 \u2014 his first glibc change in 2018.  He did\nnot post his change to the mailing \nlist (and only explained it after being\nasked); his attempt to justify it as a return to consensus did not fly with O'Donell.  This discussion,\none suspects, is not done.\n \nEach project has its own governance model.  The \"authoritarian leader\"\nmodel is quite common in this space, with many projects subject to the will\nof a (hopefully benevolent) dictator who can decide to accept or reject any\nchange.  Sometimes that model works better than others; glibc itself\nimproved its processes and inclusiveness considerably when its single\nleader was replaced by a more consensus-oriented model.  Usually, though,\nsuch leaders are at least active developers in the projects they manage;\nthat is not the case for the GNU projects.  It can be discouraging for a\ndeveloper to discover that their changes are subject to a veto from on\nhigh by somebody who is not otherwise involved with the project's\ndevelopment.  The echoes of this action may thus persist in the glibc\ncommunity \nfor some time. \n \n \n\n Who controls glibc?

If you read a discussion thread about this, you might conclude that the consensus is opposed, but the real consensus is closer to \"meh\".\n \nAnyway, I'm not asking to be a jerk.  I genuinely curious.  Do glibc developers have some sort of polling mechanism to determine consensus?\n \n Who controls glibc? Posted May 7, 2018 19:56 UTC (Mon) by siddhesh (subscriber, #64914)\n       [Link]\n     \nWhen 45 out of 50 do not respond, it's not necessary they they don't care, quite often the case is that they agree with the current state, which may either be of consensus or of a sustained opposition and don't want to get involved in the conversation unless absolutely necessary. Most contributors to glibc (even the most active ones) are usually working on the project in addition to another project, like gcc or the kernel so they're juggling multiple things at once.\n \nThe article links to a wiki page that describes the consensus rules we use in glibc in quite a bit of detail.\n \n Who controls glibc? Posted May 7, 2018 22:15 UTC (Mon) by k8to (subscriber, #15413)\n       [Link]\n     \nIn the Quaker tradition of consensus decision making, it's a matter of making a best effort to find what the group as a whole wants.\n \nIn that tradition  it's considered a mistake to try to build a consensus without hearing from at least most of the members.  However, it's also built around the idea that people who are going to participate essentially opt into discussion in certain areas, and have explicitly taken on the duty of participating, even when it's time consuming and slow, which are par for the course in classic consensus decision making.  Essentially, everyone is given time to speak about what they think and what they feel, and when the turn comes to you, you can't just pass or stay silent.  It would be difficult to adapt this fully to an online medium.  Functioning well, this can include outcomes such as participants deciding that they really are too far outside the group needs\/wants to be part of the decision and essentially pulling up their stake.  It can also include the group as a whole working hard to understand the views and opinions of one who sees it quite differently.\n \nIn the general modern interpretation of consensus decision making, participants are often far less committed to fully participate, and would rather simply ignore issues that are insufficiently important to them, or have a poor ratio of importance to expected annoyance.  In such an environment, I really don't see what you can do besides try to remember that each participant's views should be given real consideration, and at the same time that it is important and necessary to find the outcome\/view\/decision that best represents the group overall.   Even that is hard to instill in a free assocation of developers, and I think it's generally not perceived that this mode of thinking is important and possibly essential.\n \nIn short, consensus is hard.  We're not really trained to do it.  Most of us don't really fully appreciate the components to achieve it.  Expecting strong consensus on mailing lists is perhaps a foolish pursuit.  But considering how things are playing out here, I do wish more of the participants valued those principles.\n \n Who controls glibc?

There isn't actually a \"none of the above\" box but it's perfectly legal to turn up to the polling station and hand in a ruined ballot card, which is the defacto way of abstaining.\n \nIt's indeed a bit presumptuous to lump \"I don't care\" with \"I strongly disagree with all options\" in the absence of a voting system that doesn't distinguish between those options. However, on a software project mailing list, it's not the case that there are a fixed number of options to vote for---if somebody disagrees with all possible proposals that have already been suggested, they're free to introduce an alternative suggestion. So in that context it does seem reasonable to read an abstention as \"I don't care about this issue\" or \"I agree with whatever the current consensus is\".\n \n Who controls glibc?

It comes off (to me) as implying that anti-abortion viewpoints are not valid, while trying to aim at anti-abortion government censorship.  And while I think this is a serious political issue, making a polemic claim dressed up as a joke always strikes me as less than forthright.  It's a tricky thing because expressing a political view as a real zingy joke can please me, sometimes even when I don't agree with the point of view.  However, a really hamfisted joke placed in a context where it has almost no relevance comes across as unwanted and unpleasant.  And I agree with both political views embedded in the comment.\n \nSo that's why I don't much like it.\n \nOf course, my views are not particularly important, but I wanted to present what I think is a useful alternative to \"this is unprofessional\".\n \n Who controls glibc?

Yeah, it's a tangent from your main point, so sorry about that, but I'm not taking you out of context when I quote: am I? You do effectively say \"The joke comes off as implying that anti-abortion viewpoints are not valid\", don't you? And I just didn't understand how you read that from the joke. So, I was a bit confused there. I'm also not entirely sure how I'm being uncharitable by asking how you got the meaning you did? I am genuinely curious about that.

Posted May 9, 2018 20:35 UTC (Wed) by k8to (subscriber, #15413)\n       [Link]\n     \nThe implications of the joke as implying anti-abortion views are invalid are probably a bit Americentric.\n \nIt's *very* hard in US politics to imagine someone injecting their views in this hamfisted way in the wrong forum as believing anything except that the opposing views are fundamentally invalid.  This is because these views are so often extremely strident and because one who was more interested in discussion of the topic would not intrude in such a way.\n \nThis is not to say that I personally believe RMS feels this way.  I have no real idea.  But I do think it's how it reads, which makes it pretty derailing.  \n \n Who controls glibc?

For instance, if I'm interacting with someone on behalf of Debian, I should be polite, so that they won't go away thinking \"Debian people are rude\".\n \nThere's a time and a place to draw attention to US government policies, but I don't think the glibc reference manual is it. If GNU manuals make political points about Free Software, that's at least a relevant topic (although reference documentation about particular functions wouldn't seem like a great place for that, and indeed the political parts of GNU manuals tend to be in their own section), but political points about topics unrelated to software seem like something that should be elsewhere - both for the benefit of the glibc manual (a greater proportion of relevant text) and for the benefit of the political point being made (more visible to people who don't routinely read the glibc manual).\n \nHaving pseudo-legalistic disclaimers in a reference manual for the sake of political satire also seems inadvisable if the writer wants readers to take *actual* legal disclaimers seriously. (See also Firefox's \"This might void your warranty!\" warning on entering about:config in the en_US locale, which has been criticized for undermining the rather important point that Firefox specifically doesn't have a warranty; the en_GB localization to \"Here be dragons!\" seems a lot better, since it's more obviously a whimsical phrasing of a general admonition to be careful.)\n \n Who controls glibc?

(And it sounds like this patch was being handled efficiently until Stallman got involved). Sometimes projects will explicitly talk about paper cuts (minor usability bugs that are individually unimportant, but a user who encounters dozens of them will be strongly put off) and technical debt (problems that weren't worth fixing in the short term, but their cost will accumulate until they seriously impede development) because they're aware they need to deal with those minor issues - it's tempting to ignore them and focus on the highest-priority issues instead, but it's important for the project's long-term health to work on the little things too.\n \n(Besides, in this specific case it's easy to find people like https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/48445031\/why-would-it... who seem genuinely confused by the statement and wasted an appreciable amount of time trying to understand it, so it's not a hypothetical problem.)\n \n Who controls glibc?

Again, not for the joke but because of the authority he is trying to exercise over something so minuscule. If anything deserves \"RIP for glibc\" it's his behavior, not the 30 seconds of work it took to remove a dumb joke. And if jokes like that aren't turning people away, it will be seeing arguments like his unfold that will make potential contributors go \"oooh...maybe I don't want to get into the middle of that culture...\"\n \nAnd all of that you could ultimately blame on someone making minor changes that don't need to happen, fine whatever maybe you're right.

Even with 'most people' ruled out of the audience, you'd further have to rule out the people who were already aware of the proposed legislation: it doesn't help to 'raise awareness' if you're only hitting a limited echo chamber.\n \nIf you don't want to design for corner cases, take it out (it just isn't helpful), and replace it with an explicit statement which clearly informs the reader, makes a well-argued position, and suggests how to take action. That's so clear and unambiguous that anyone will be able to follow.\n \nOh, and removing it also has the benefit of not raising negative reactions in others. Be it because people are offended by the discussion, or because they've had personal experience and it brings only an unexpected and unwelcome reminder, somewhere it has no place appearing and adds no value.\n \n Who controls glibc?

Any governance model that empowers one person that way seems rather dangerous to me.  It's also not compatible with how tax-exempt non-profits should be run in the United States.  (I realize that many of them, particularly ones founded by charismatic leaders, are run that way, but I think that's a bug, not a feature.)\n \nThe Free Software Foundation, like any other tax-exempt US non-profit, has a board of directors who are legally responsible for the actions of the FSF as a whole.  They certainly are, and should be, reluctant to override RMS, but they should be capable of doing so if the situation warrants.  (Jokes in manuals definitely don't; questions of maintenance authority for well-run GNU projects might.)\n \nIf RMS wants an organization that he solely and exclusively controls, well, don't make it a tax-exempt non-profit.  Receiving preferential treatment from society and government because your organization supports the public good comes with an obligation to be responsible to the public and a board of directors for one's actions.\n \nAnd even short of that (I certainly hope this particular issue doesn't get escalated to that level), devolution of authority is generally a good thing.  GNU maintainers should be empowered to make decisions about the software they maintain in areas that aren't foundational.  And this fairly obviously isn't foundational -- how many people reading this even knew that passage was there?  Given that, how much influence could it have possibly had over the political question it tries to address?\n \n Who controls glibc?

For example, the Queen of Australia (a title held by the Queen of the United Kingdom) appoints and replaces our governor-general. Formally she has the complete power to do so, but de facto she does so only on the advice of Australia's Prime Minister, and it would be a constitutional\/international incident if she \"interfered\" by declining to follow our PM's advice. So in practice she does not have control of who Australia's governor-general is.\n \nStallman may or may not formally be in control of GNU libc, but is he willing to replace all its maintainers in order to keep this one line?\n \n Who controls glibc?

This is clearly a case where Mr. Stallman has a particular set of values and priorities and some number of contributors differ in these. So, if it is not possible to achieve agreement, the next question is what paths do the various parties find suitable to  their respective wishes? It may be that, overall, the desire to continue as a single project takes priority and whoever has the ultimate decision-making power gets to decide. Deciding who has that power would, in this case, need to involve a high degree of willingness in others to gracefully yield on this decision. If having one project is not the priority, well, GNU software can fork, too. I do hope that all involved realized that this is both an issue which is about as important as most bikeshedding issues, and another one which is defining the answer to a really important question of the GNU C direction setting and that the two shouldn't be confused. \n Who controls glibc?

By what metric the developers made their individual choices is also not especially relevant. They made their own decisions by their own value systems (whether we agree with them or not), and their aggregate decision should be respected.\n \nAlternatively, the stated governance model is bullshit. If that's the case and the actual governance model is \"Stallman is a god\" then the joke should stay in. Why he feels that way is also irrelevant if that indeed is the control structure.\n \nIn both of these cases, there is a risk of political fallout. Loss of key people, reduction in morale, wasted time\/energy and a risk of fork\/migration.\n \nOf course, the actual governing model might actually be something else, or very much about to be remade (English nobility vs the King, anyone?).\n \nDiscussing whether the joke is offensive or appropriate or not is the wrong argument, at least with regards to the matter at hand.

This can be minimized if everyone accepts this is the governance model, but that's not at all what consensus means.\n \nIt's apparent that at least some project members do not agree with the removal.  The ideal next step is for all parties to work to better understand the nature of the disagreement, and for individuals to consider their reasons for their viewpoints in light of the viewpoints of others etc.  Essentially, in consesnsus process, the decision is not made, and may take some time to achieve.\n \nThat said, there are definitely some participants who are not really trying to follow that model here.\n \n Who controls glibc?

I mostly base that opinion on a) that there is formal and detailed governance documentation, and b) that he's the sort who knows the rules inside and out (probably wrote most of them) and wouldn't say what he did if he didn't think he could back it up in triplicate. Nonetheless, I'm sure that will be part of the ensuing discussion.\n \nThat said, legal and wise are not necessarily the same thing. This seems like an odd thing to rarely assert one's authority over, at least from a practical standpoint. I'm sure he at least partially sees this passage as illustrating some principle of free speech, but there are many other opportunities for such expression that don't come with in-fighting and risk of escalation attached.\n \nHe likely has the authority to do it, but it seems like a bit of a bad call.\n \n Who controls glibc?

Unless developers make use of the Graph, which is the API that provides the connectivity between everything from Windows 10 to Office 365, it won\u2019t reach its potential, after all. Microsoft describes the Graph as \u201cthe API for Microsoft 365.\u201d And indeed, Microsoft 365 is the second topic the company is really hammering home during its event. It\u2019s a combined subscription service for Office 365, Windows 10 and the company\u2019s enterprise mobility services. \u201cMicrosoft 365 is where the world gets its best work done,\u201d said Microsoft corporate vice president Joe Belfiore. \u201cWith 135 million commercial monthly active users of Office 365 and nearly 700 million Windows 10 connected devices, Microsoft 365 helps developers reach people how and where they work.\u201d Leaving the standard keynote hyperbole aside, that is indeed how Microsoft sees this service \u2014 and the connective tissue here is the Microsoft Graph.  The Graph is what powers features like the Windows 10 Timeline, which desperately needs buy-in from developers to succeed, but it also allows developers to send notifications when a file is added to a OneDrive folder or to kick off an onboarding workflow when a new person is added to a team in Azure Active Directory. At Build, Microsoft is talking about the Graph quite a bit and Microsoft\u2019s Director for Office 365 Ecosystem Marketing Rob Howard told me that the company now believes that all the engagement surfaces to highlight Graph data are in place. \u201cDevelopers now have a reason to put their data into the graph,\u201d he said. Specifically, he expects developers to make use of the Windows 10 Timeline feature, which has now rolled out with the latest Windows 10 release. He also expects that the deep integration into the Office 365 apps will provide a bit of inspiration to third-party developers. As for Microsoft 365, the company is emphasizing the developer opportunity\u00a0here. Besides more consumer-facing features like \u2018Your Phone\u2019 for sending text messages and reacting to notifications from your phone, and integrating Timeline into the company\u2019s Android Launcher, Microsoft is also launching things like .NET Core 3.0 today, an update to the MSIX packaging format for shipping large applications, Sets in Windows 10 and support for Adaptive Cards within Microsoft 365. This last one may just be the most interesting of these (except for maybe Sets) because users will soon see these cards pop up across Microsoft\u2019s applications. Adaptive Cards is a standard that Microsoft has proposed for allowing developers to describe their content and user interface in a simple JSON file. The general idea here is to enable developers to show these cards in applications like Teams and Outlook to allow their users to take actions right within those applications. That could mean paying a bill right inside of Outlook, for example, or accepting a pull request from GitHub in Teams.

As a student developer at Launch School encountering relational database concepts and PostgreSQL for the first time, I wanted to know more about this Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) with the funny-sounding name, so I looked it up. Here\u2019s what I found: 1973 was the year that saw the end of US involvement in the Vietnam War, the year that English rock band Deep Purple released Smoke on the Water, and the year the US Supreme Court ruled on Roe v. Wade. People were sporting Farrah Fawcett hairstyles and computer technologies were changing the way businesses operated. The corporate sector was driving development of Database Management Systems (DBMS), using them to maintain information about clients, vendors, employees, inventory, supplies, product orders, and service requests. At the same time, in a lab at the University of California at Berkeley, Eugene Wong and Michael Stonebraker were beginning work on INGRES (INteractive GRaphics REtrieval System), one of the world\u2019s first RDBMSs. Initially, the researchers had raised funds to build a geographic database system for Berkeley\u2019s economics group (1). However, inspired by Edgar Codd\u2019s 1970 seminal work on the relational model (2) and by white papers that IBM had just released regarding SystemR\u200a\u2014\u200athe first implementation of SQL and an experimental database system built on the relational data model (3, 4), the two researchers decided to use the money to seed their relational database project instead (1). For the ongoing support of the larger INGRES project, the two received funding from the National Science Foundation and three military agencies: the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the Army Research Office, and the Navy Electronic Systems Command (1, 5). The context of the military\u2019s interest in the development of such systems, together with the the confluence of the Cold War and the emergence of computer technologies to manage information, likely influenced the system\u2019s concern with access control, protection, security, ownership, and the database \u201cadministrator.\u201d The INGRES system fulfilled the requirements for database systems built on a relational model of data presented by Codd (1970): 1) information is presented by data values (rather than by \u2018connections\u2019 visible to the user), and 2) the use of a high-level declarative language with which users can query data without specifying algorithms (4). Essentially, the relational model required being both more user-friendly and robust to inevitable change. This model was seen as diametrically opposed to the navigational database model, which came with a greater degree of data-dependence, meaning that application code needs to change whenever the data structure changes (8). On the other hand, a relational database system maintains keys, indices, and other \u201caids\u201d used for processing user queries (e.g., a SELECT statement to represent \u201cWhat is the lowest price of bolts?\u201d) without the user having to include any information about these \u201caids\u201d into their request, therefore existing applications won\u2019t break when a system changes data representation or access aids (4). See Figures 1 and 2 below for a visual comparison of a navigational database and a relational database. A navigational database program maintains a current position in any sequence of records being processed (8), thus \u201cconnections\u201d are visible, whereas a relational database abstracts these connections into a third keyed relation. Unlike SystemR which used SQL, INGRES, which was itself programmed in C, supported QUEL (QUEry Language) as the primary query language. See further reading on the linguistic differences between SQL and QUEL. So why aren\u2019t INGRES or QUEL household names? By the early 1980\u2019s, INGRES and Oracle RDBMS, with equivocal functionality, performance, market share, and pricing, were running neck and neck, but ultimately the increasing adoption of SQL (versus QUEL) as the preferred query language and Oracle\u2019s aggressive marketing won the day. INGRES did ultimately convert from QUEL-based to SQL-based, but by that time it had already lost market dominance (1). While INGRES is still alive today in the form of the Actian X Hybrid Database, the UC Berkeley INGRES research project officially ended in 1985 (1). As the name suggests, Postgres was introduced in 1986 as a Post-INGRES evolution of a RDBMS that sought to fill the gaps of existing implementations. Postgres aimed to incorporate object-oriented data models (i.e., Object-Relational Database Management System), to add complete types support and the ability to define types, and to add the ability to fully describe relationships\u200a\u2014\u200awhich had previously been widely used but maintained entirely by the user. Unlike previous systems, Postgres \u201cunderstood\u201d relationships, and could retrieve information in related tables in a natural way using rules (6). For more information on the query rewrite rules system, see PostgreSQL Documentation. Postgres used the POSTQUEL query language until 1994 when Postgres95 replaced it with support for the SQL language. In 1996, the PostgreSQL project changed its name to reflect both its relationship with the original Postgres project and the more recent SQL capability (7). The PostgreSQL project continues to make major releases, all available under a free and open-source license (6). 1969 CODASYL publishes first specifications for network database model 1970 Codd\u2019s seminal work on relational model of data published 1973 IBM publishes on work which would become known as SystemR 1974 SystemR (SQL) 1974 INGRES (QUEL) 1979 Oracle (SQL) 1986 POSTGRES (POSTQUEL) 1994 Postgres95 (SQL) 1996 PostgreSQL (SQL) https:\/\/launchschool.com\/books\/sql https:\/\/www.postgresql.org\/docs\/9.1\/static\/biblio.html#ONG90 By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.

There are more online shops than ever before and thousands of new businesses pop up each day. New services and product offerings all around the world try to sell us something every minute of the day. In the last 10 years our shopping behavior has changed dramatically and today we tend to buy almost everything online: pizza, Nike shoes, the latest Xbox, small business CRM, accounting software, and even the new Tesla Model S. You can launch your WooCommerce shop in less than an hour and all you need is a domain, a theme, a few plugins and a payment processor. It\u2019s also easier than ever to start your SaaS business, sell your service, capture recurring revenue and bootstrap it to the next level! eCommerce shop owners and digital product providers would like a slice of the cake but as these industries continue to grow, so do incidents of eCommerce\/SaaS credit card fraud. If you\u2019re a business owner probably you\u2019re probably familiar with this situation and are always looking for new ways to reduce the number of fraudulent transactions, and better yet, prevent them as much as possible. Just to make sure we are on the same page, here is a brief description of online payments fraud: Online payments fraud involves an individual obtaining someone else\u2019s credit card number and using it to make unauthorized online purchases. The individual might buy an item (or buy a digital product) and later resell it online for a fraction of the real price. The original cardholder (at some point) will discover this unauthorized transaction and initiate a dispute (chargeback) with their bank. It\u2019s frustrating, isn\u2019t it? I know how you feel. They cause your business constant headaches and more importantly cost you lot of money. If you\u2019re using Stripe as your online payment processor than this post is for you.\u00a0\ud83d\udc4d I\u2019ll show you how Stripe Radar can make your life easier! Thanks to this machine learning based solution we were able to reduce credit fraud by 98% at Kinsta. We don\u2019t have to spend any more time reviewing disputed charges and suspicious signups. And believe me, that\u2019s a pretty good feeling! Let\u2019s dive into the details. It\u2019s not surprising, but the volume of digital fraud is rapidly increasing. Today we\u2019ll use some of the numbers from the survey conducted by Pymts and Forter in 2016. You can download the full study from this\u00a0link. Here are some of the most interesting findings: Digital fraud trends (Image source:\u00a0Pymts and Forter) Fraud attacks by industry\u00a0(Image source:\u00a0Pymts and Forter) According to the\u00a0LexisNexis\u2019 study, annual fraud costs for US retailers reached $32 billion in 2014. Retailers lost an estimated 1.3% of revenue in 2015, more than double the rate of 2014.\u00a0Ouch,\u00a0\ud83d\ude2e that\u2019s a lot of money. Below you can see the volume of attacks per 1,000 transactions in 2015. Online fraud attack rate The most affected industries are digital goods, clothing, electronics, food, and luxury. We can see that these are serious numbers and we\u2019re talking about a lot of lost revenue when it comes to online payments fraud. I\u2019m sure you know the answer but let me summarize for you the real consequences of online fraud and how it impacts your business. First, it doesn\u2019t let you focus on your business. If your online store or SaaS (software as a service) has a high number of sales or sign-ups you\u2019ll have to spend a lot of time dealing with fraudulent transactions, purchases,\u00a0and disputed charges. You\u2019re running a business and you can not afford to spend your entire day dealing with these types of problems. You have to figure out how to automate it and prevent them before they happen. Second, it can be devastating when one day you wake up and you notice you\u2019re out of business because your payment processor suspended your account.\u00a0\ud83d\ude49 Trust me I know what I\u2019m talking about. In the early days of our business, our payment processor closed our account because of some fraudulent transactions and we were suddenly at a standstill. We weren\u2019t able to collect our revenue and get new customers to sign up for our service. Yeah, it sucked but thank God it was resolved quickly. However, that not always the case. You can read the full horrifying story here. Third and most importantly, chargebacks are extremely expensive. eCommerce lost nearly $7 billion to chargebacks in 2016. By 2020, eCommerce chargeback losses are expected to balloon to $31 billion. Here are what chargebacks can cost you with some of the popular payment processors: Look at the calculation below and see just how much a single chargeback can hurt your business and profitability. When a business is being targeted by individuals committing fraud, these costs can add up and have a significant impact on your business\u2019s financials! Break-even precision model If you want to use your own numbers you can play with the calculator here. All right, that\u2019s enough for the introduction, let\u2019s dive into how Stripe Radar works and how you can use it to reduce the risk of fraudulent purchases. Stripe Radar In the last few years, Stripe has become of the most trusted and well-known online payment processors. Two Irish entrepreneurs, John and Patrick Collison, founded Stripe in 2010, and since then the company\u2019s growth has been exponential. Powering more than 100,000 businesses and handling $50 billion in commerce annually, Stripe\u2019s 900+ talented employees are a guarantee that your business is in good hands. Right now Stripe is in our opinion the best solution for both private individuals and businesses to accept payments online and in mobile apps. Implementing Stripe in your online store is super easy, working with their code is like a dream (if a PayPal executive is reading this please learn from these guys on how to make your platform usable\u2026), and they have the most developer-friendly solution. Radar is a Stripe product which was originally\u00a0launched\u00a0back in October 2016. I was super excited and happy that Kinsta was among the beta users and we were able to test and experiment with this tool to see it\u2019s full potential. Actually, we even provided feedback and suggestions to help improve the platform further. Radar is a tool which helps you to prevent fraudulent payments and reduce credit card fraud, with the option to manually review suspicious payments. These suspicious payments are automatically flagged for review either by Radar\u2019s machine learning system or when they trigger a custom rule you previously configured. Earlier this year, Radar 2.0 was launched and it comes with even more features and enhanced advanced machine learning to catch additional fraudulent activity. Stripe Radar 2.0 Radar\u2019s machine learning system is getting smarter day by day, thanks to the thousands of users who are configuring their custom rules and manually blocking suspicious payments. Radar is not perfect, as I still occasionally see an obvious fraud sign up which wasn\u2019t blocked automatically by the system. But I\u2019d like to emphasize that Radar makes our life so much easier that I can\u2019t thank them enough. Now let\u2019s dive into Radar\u2019s features and custom rules! I won\u2019t go into all the technical\u00a0details of how Radar works, as I don\u2019t even know all the fine details, other than it\u2019s based on a machine learning system. Stripe manages tens of millions of transactions each day and it means that they have an incredibly large pool of data. Millions of credit card details are processed by their systems and analyzed by algorithms looking for patterns to identify every single transaction and mark them as safe or fraudulent. Radar scans every payment to help identify and prevent fraud. But we have to feed these algorithms with new actions and information to train them to become smarter. And that is where Stripe\u2019s large user base comes into play. Stripe payment blocked Each time we manually review a transaction and take some type of action we train Stripe\u2019s machine learning algorithm to become more sophisticated. Whenever you manually review fraudulent activity, looking for suspicious information, there are details attached that will clearly show you that specific purchase or signup was fraudulent. Based on a higher number of manual reviews you should be able to easily spot a pattern. Chances are good that you can then set up a custom rule so that the algorithm will identify and block these types of transactions going forward. Payment fraud Less fraudulent transactions mean fewer chargebacks and more money in your packet. So what can you do to quickly spot fraudulent activity? Well, let\u2019s take a look at this screenshot below. Fraudulent user activity Here\u2019s what we see. A guy called Ranji from Nepal tried to sign up for a service with a card issued in Austria (The distance from Nepal to Austria is only 6,089 km). This is already slightly suspicious, but when you see that the cardholder\u2019s name is not Ranji but Caroline, now you can be 99.9% sure that this is fraudulent activity and should be blocked, as well as reported. The good news is that Stripe catches these activities with a pretty good success rate and they rarely result in actual purchases. But sometimes it still happens and if you notice you get a lot of strange activity like this you can always configure a custom rule. The complete list of Radar rule references with detailed explanations\u00a0can be found here. To create a rule, select \u201cRadar\u201d on the left and choose \u201cRules.\u201d Stripe Radar rules menu Select the \u201cWhen should a payment be blocked section\u201d, scroll down and click on \u201cAdd Rule.\u201d Stripe Radar add rule After that, you will see this popup called \u201cAdd a rule for blocking payments\u201d. Stripe Radar \u2013 add a rule for blocking payments This is where we will add our first custom rule. So what we would like to achieve is to block all payments where the location of the user doesn\u2019t equal the original location of the credit card. Note: sometimes it could still be a legitimate purchase, but honestly it\u2019s a bit far from reality that an Austrian user during her Nepal holiday would buy a SaaS service (not to mention the names didn\u2019t match).

Let\u2019s say the individual from Nepal constantly tries to make a purchase. All you need to do is find the ISO two letters country code (here is a complete list) and add the following rule to Radar: Country and card doesn\u2019t match rule What exactly does this rule do? From now on, Stripe will block all transactions when someone with a Nepalese IP address tries to make a purchase with a credit card issued in Austria. Here are a few more examples: If you would like to block payments made from the UK with a French credit card, this is the rule you would add: Or if someone tried to purchase your product with an Italian card but the email address wasn\u2019t from Italy, this is the rule you would add: As you can see, the possibilities when it comes to configuring these rules are limitless. If you click on the \u201cTest Rule\u201d button the system will check the transaction history and see if they can match any previous attempts. If you see a lot of recent payment attempts and you already know those are legitimate purchases (let\u2019s say you recognize the customers), you probably shouldn\u2019t activate the rule as it will block these valid transactions. If there aren\u2019t any after testing the rule or you just see fraudulent attempts, click \u201cAdd and Enable\u201d and that\u2019s it. You can easily edit, delete, or disable rules anytime. Now on to the next useful rule. Fraudulent users love to use disposable email addresses. There are a lot of these providers out there where you can buy email addresses or even create them in bulk. The good news is that you can entirely block these email domains by adding a simple rule to Radar. Let\u2019s say the email provider is shadyemail.com. That\u2019s the rule you will need to add: Block email addresses in Stripe Radar Test the rule and then enable it. The result? No one will be able to make any purchases with this domain (email addresses on the domain). If you notice that you get a lot of fraudulent signups from a specific IP address you can also add this to Radar. It\u2019s useful to add it even after the fraudulent purchase because this way you can make sure Radar will block it in the future. If you\u2019ve tracked down the IP address (you can find it in Stripe if you select the specific purchase and check the associated logs) all you need to do is add the following rule: Block IP Address in Stripe Radar Test the rule and enable it. Let\u2019s say you don\u2019t ship your product to a specific country or you don\u2019t want to provide a digital service for customers based in that country. Perhaps you have a lot of fraudulent signups from this country and you would like to simply block them. For this example, we are using Morocco (sorry guys). Below is the rule you would need to add: This will block all attempts made from any IP addresses based in Morocco. Block country in Stripe Radar Another useful rule is to manage the declines and failed payment attempts made by the same customer or from the same IP address in a short period of time. Legitimate customers shouldn\u2019t need 6 attempts to make a purchase as they usually know their card details and have enough funds to cover it. If the credit card being used is stolen, the person often doesn\u2019t know all details, and therefore keeps\u00a0trying to sign up or make the purchase with slightly different details. In this example below the individual used seven different credit cards within a 15 minute period. Seems legitimate, right? Failed payment attempts in Stripe Radar I\u2019m sure they would have tried more but they probably ran out of credit cards.\u00a0\ud83d\ude02 And there was a chance that the next card would have worked! That\u2019s why you should limit the declines. Here are a just a few different attributes you can use to limit them: For example, let\u2019s say we want to block the next attempts where a customer tried to make a purchase five times during a 60 minute period, but the transaction has been declined by the bank. If it was a fraudulent person they wouldn\u2019t be able to make a sixth purchase. If it was a legitimate customer, and for some reason, five attempts weren\u2019t enough, they could always call their bank for further help. Below is the rule you would add: Stripe Radar declines per hour rule You can also limit the number of times a card is charged to the account in the past hour by using this rule: Again, the complete list of rules can be found here. As a Stripe customer, I remember the early days when I tried to figure out how to reduce the number of fraudulent attempts and signups. I spent countless hours reviewing every single malicious transaction trying to find patterns. Now it\u2019s as easy as adding a custom rule to Radar to prevent future attempts. I\u2019m confident to say that Stripe\u2019s algorithm has been improved a lot, even within the last few months.\u00a0 They are doing an awesome job with Stripe Radar 2.0. Compared to the early years,\u00a0I can say that our volume of fraudulent transactions has been reduced by 98% by simply enabling a few custom rules and letting their algorithm do its job. Even without my custom rules, Stripe is now able to block most of the fraudulent attempts. But it\u2019s better to play it safe and enable a few tested rules. I highly recommend you use Stripe and all the features Radar has to offer. If you\u2019re a current Stripe user, I would love to hear your thoughts. How do you use Radar, what custom rules have you enabled, and what has been your experience so far? Last, but not least, if you found this guide helpful please share it with your friends and followers! Great article guys. I\u2019ve been hit with this lately however stripe Radar is not available with all users. I sent them an email to ask for it so it is something to be aware of. Hey Matt, you should be able to activate Radar 2.0. See details at bottom of the article here: https:\/\/stripe.com\/blog\/radar-2018 I think they are still rolling out the new features to some accounts. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll hear back from them. \ud83d\udc4d We had Stripe for a while and quite frankly they approved most everything and even those that were blatantly fraudulent. Our own fraud evaluation fortunately stopped us from shipping product, but we still had the chargeback fees.  Stripe was getting paid a fee regardless. We switched to PayPal Braintree, where the approval process seems to be more finely tuned to identify fraud.

A deal reached in January to buy thousands of additional Chrysler Pacifica minivans, which get kitted out with sensors that can see hundreds of yards in any direction, puts Waymo\u2019s lead into stark relief. No other company is offering for-hire rides yet, let alone preparing to carry passengers in more than one city this year.\u00a0 GM plans to start a ride-hailing service with its Chevrolet Bolt\u2014the one with no steering wheel or pedals, the ultimate goal in autonomous technology\u2014late next year, assuming the U.S. government has protocols in place by then. Most of the others trying solve the last remaining self-driving puzzles are more cautious, targeting 2020 or later. The road to autonomy is long and exceedingly complicated. It can also be dangerous: Two high-profile efforts, from Uber Technologies Inc. and Tesla Inc., were involved in recent crashes that caused the death of a pedestrian (in the first known case of a person killed by a self-driving vehicle) and a driver using an assistance program touted as a precursor to autonomy. One of\u00a0Waymo\u2019s\u00a0autonomous vans was involved in a collision just last week.\u00a0But the perceived stakes are so enormous, with the promise of transport businesses needing little in labor costs, that many players are racing to master the technology and put it to work. Without drivers, operating margins could be ... more than twice what carmakers generate right now In the next three years, almost all of these contenders will be able show off cars capable of navigating city streets at casual speeds along firmly fixed routes. Most of the companies now building autonomous vehicles can already handle basic driving at low speeds. This can give an impression of parity and sameness. Yet despite being in its infancy, autonomous driving has leaders starting to emerge. \u201cWaymo has developed a phenomenal system and is ahead of the pack,\u201d said Brian Collie, head of Boston Consulting Group\u2019s U.S. automotive practice, who singled out the top two. \u201cBut that\u2019s very different from being able to manufacture an autonomous vehicle. You have to look at GM. In Europe, Daimler is leading the pack.\u201d The finish line isn\u2019t just reaching Level 4 on the five-step scale of autonomous driving. That\u2019s the threshold at which a car can drive on pre-mapped routes and handle anything on its planned course without the intervention of a driver. Only Waymo has tested Level 4 vehicles on passengers who aren\u2019t its employees\u2014and those people volunteered to be test subjects. No one has yet demonstrated at Level 5, where the car is so independent that there\u2019s no steering wheel. The victors will also need to pioneer businesses around the technology. Delivery and taxi services capable of generating huge profits is the end game for all.\u00a0 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicts that robo-taxis will help the ride-hailing and -sharing business grow from $5 billion in revenue today to $285 billion by 2030. There are grand hopes for this business. Without drivers, operating margins could be in the 20 percent range, more than twice what carmakers generate right now. If that kind of growth and profit come to pass\u2014very big ifs\u2014it would be almost three times what GM makes in a year. And that doesn\u2019t begin to count the money to be made in delivery. Why does it matter who gets there first? To make a driverless business work takes a big fleet to establish service in major markets, as well as a brand name that becomes as synonymous with getting a ride as Uber is today. Observers expect the field to narrow. For now, investors are throwing money at possible winners \u201cThere won\u2019t be a ton of companies doing this,\u201d Collie said. \u201cThere will be a select few. Being there first establishes consumer trust. Brand value matters.\u201d For now, investors are throwing money at possible winners. Tesla\u2019s valuation soared in 2016 after an analyst from Morgan Stanley, also its lead underwriter, speculated that the company\u2019s electric cars would spawn a self-driving fleet. GM shares are up 20 percent since a June 2017 announcement that a plant to build driverless vehicles was up and running. Zoox Inc. has already raised $360 million, a huge sum for a startup with no revenue. Of course, the era when most people ditch their driver\u2019s licenses and rely on self-driving taxis remains far off. The technology costs more than the cars, and with few players actually testing the cars for the public, widespread adoption is years away. Even Waymo is still in the pilot stage.\u00a0 The most aggressive forecasts have the majority of people driving their own cars for at least the next decade. Chris Urmson, founder of Aurora Innovation INC.\u00a0and one of the pioneers of the field, counts as one of the optimists. \u201cI can see these on the road in real numbers in five to 10 years,\u201d he said. That means even today\u2019s laggards have time to catch up. After interviewing executives and technology experts and reviewing announced plans, Bloomberg has taken a snapshot of the race to develop the self-driving car. Our estimated time of autonomy is based on Level 4, the prerequisite for launching businesses with self-driving tech. Waymo has run self-driving cars over 5 million road miles in 25 cities and done billions of miles in computer simulation, which it uses to update its self-driving software on a weekly basis. The Google-launched company has a fleet of Chrysler Pacifica minivans that can navigate city streets in San Francisco and reach full speed on highways. A pilot program of driverless vans will begin commercial service later this year, picking up paying passengers in Phoenix and branching out from there. Waymo Chief Executive John Krafcik recently announced a deal to add 20,000 Jaguar I-Pace SUVs to the fleet and signaled that an in-the-works alliance with Honda Motor Co. could focus on delivery and logistics.\u00a0 The company also has by far the lowest rate of disengagement\u2014times when an engineer needs to grab the wheel because the bot couldn\u2019t handle it\u2014among all companies testing cars in California, a hub of autonomous research that\u00a0also requires detailed disclosures. It also reported fewer accidents while testing in California last year: Waymo had three collisions over more than 350,000 miles, while GM had 22 over 132,000 miles. GM\u2019s Chevy Bolt can navigate the busy streets of San Francisco at speeds up to 25 miles per hour. The Detroit automaker is so confident that it plans to run a ride-hailing pilot next year in a car with no steering wheel or pedals, something only Waymo has done in road testing. After Waymo, a handful of major players have demonstrated similar driving capabilities. It\u2019s hard to say anyone has an edge. One advantage for GM: There's a factory north of Detroit that can crank out self-driving Bolts. That will help GM get manufacturing right and lower costs\u00a0without relying on partners. Right now, an autonomous version of the car costs around $200,000 to build, compared to a sticker price of $35,000 for an electric Bolt for human drivers. Where GM lags Waymo is speed. GM doesn\u2019t test\u00a0faster than 25 miles per hour, deeming that the safest top speed. Kyle Vogt, founder and chief executive of GM\u2019s Cruise Automation unit, said his program will soon be using new Lidar developed by Strobe, which the automaker acquired last year. Lidar sends out laser beams to map the road ahead and guide the car, and Strobe\u2019s version is smaller, cheaper and can see farther ahead than GM\u2019s existing equipment. That will enable faster driving. The new equipment will also cut costs.\u00a0Lidar alone on the current generation of autonomous Bolts\u00a0costs about $30,000 a car, Vogt said in November. When GM starts using Strobe, Vogt said, the cost will drop to \u201chundreds of dollars.\u201d\u00a0 GM plans to spend $1 billion of its $8 billion annual capital expenditure budget to develop\u00a0self-driving cars and mobility services. That money will allow GM the option of developing its own ride-hailing business. GM has not decided whether to run its ride-share pilot, slated for late 2019, on its own or to join forces with an established player. It\u2019s worth noting that the automaker already has a stake in Lyft\u00a0Inc. There\u2019s a big caveat with GM: It leads all companies that test in California when it comes to fender benders. Last year, Cruise had 22 of the 27 accidents in the state involving driverless cars, and it experienced five of the seven incidents reported this year. The accidents have mostly been minor and not the fault of GM\u2019s car. In an interview, GM President Dan Ammann attributed the higher incident rate to the greater number of miles traveled in San Francisco\u2019s busy streets. Mercedes-Benz started selling an adaptive cruise-control system in the late 1990s on its flagship S-class sedan. The system could sense when the car was bearing down too quickly on someone\u2019s rear bumper up ahead. Today, Mercedes models with Intelligent Drive get closer to real self-driving because the system can help steer clear of pedestrians and avoid other accidents. It\u2019s one reason why Navigant Research, which studies auto technology, ranked parent company Daimler third behind Waymo and GM. Those systems help today's drivers. For the cars of tomorrow, Daimler works closely with Robert Bosch Gmbh and will be using a system from Silicon Valley intelligent computing company Nvidia Corp.\u00a0The test cars can drive at Level 4 autonomy or even Level 5, which means the car doesn\u2019t need a steering wheel or pedals to operate. The company has been testing V-Class vans around the roads of Boeblingen, near Stuttgart, where Mercedes-Benz has a research center. The automated vans run through purposefully challenging situations such as morning traffic. The technology is already at Level 5, Daimler\u2019s head of development, Ola Kaellenius, said in an interview, although a recent report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance put the target date for the company after 2020. Before those systems are on the road, Kaellenius said Mercedes will offer Level 3 autonomy as an option in the cars it sells by 2021. This\u00a0means that the car can handle most driving while prompting the driver to take over in certain situations that the computer can\u2019t handle. Fully self-driving cars will be on the road at the same time, he said, but would be used for ride sharing services, because they would be too expensive for retail customers to buy. \u201cThe logical business case there is a mobility service, a robo-taxi type of thing,\u201d Kaellenius said. \u201cYou amortize the cost through the saving on the driver.\u201d No one would have imagined a decade ago that a vestige of bankrupt GM parts unit Delphi would be a player in the self-driving revolution. But Aptiv\u00a0Plc, the former Delphi Automotive that split out its powertrain business,\u00a0has emerged as a player to be watched, said Grayson Brulte, co-founder of\u00a0Brulte & Co., a consulting firm that specializes in autonomous strategy. Aptiv has invested heavily in self-driving technology, buying software maker Ottomatika along with stakes in\u00a0Lidar makers Innoviz, Leddertech and Quanergy Systems. Its biggest deal was buying NuTonomy, which has been running tests of driverless cars in Boston and Singapore at city speeds. The company also ran a robo-taxi demo in Las Vegas during CES. The company has been testing ride-hailing services in Singapore since 2016 and will have them operational in 2021, according to Navigant. Aptiv has been working with Audi AG and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG cars to develop its technology. The same day in late November that GM showed off its self-driving Bolt in San Francisco, Zoox Inc. had its own car driving through the city\u2019s winding streets and heavy traffic. Zoox has about 250 engineers working to develop it. Its self-driving Toyota Highlander SUVs run on the same busy streets that GM uses to test the Bolt. But Zoox\u2019s car can also drive at highway speeds, said Bert Kaufman, head of corporate and regulatory affairs for Zoox. The company plans to have its car ready for passengers in 2020, Kaufman said, and then will work on getting passengers in the car shortly after. The challenge for Zoox is getting more funding to build its car. The company has raised more than $280 million but needs an additional cash to finish its car, Kaufman said. It can cost $1 billion for car companies to finish a new model. Established carmakers have their own vehicles, and Waymo has partnerships with manufacturers. Renault-Nissan Alliance\u00a0Chairman Carlos Ghosn brags that the company has sold more cars with adaptive safety than anyone. Nissan\u2019s ProPilot system stops the car if\u00a0a vehicle ahead stops quickly and it\u00a0keeps the car in its lane. That system was developed on the way to a full autonomous system, Ghosn said in an interview earlier this year. Right now, Nissan is testing a fully-autonomous car in Palo Alto, California. Renault recently showed off a long, sleek, copper-colored concept car called the Symbioz that can go 80 miles per hour in full self-drive mode. The car still requires a driver to turn on autonomous mode, at which point the steering wheel retracts. With electric motors in front and back and measuring a lane-hogging six feet in width and 16 feet in length, Symbioz isn\u2019t exactly the car that will go on sale.\u00a0 In March, Nissan tested an electric Leaf in a ride-hailing pilot in Yokohama, and Renault will do the same later this year in suburban Paris and Rouen with the electric Renault Zoe. While the alliance's technology is impressive, Ghosn sounds cautious. The French-Japanese conglomerate plans to test a self-driver on the road around 2020.\u00a0That car will be on highways requiring only occasional driver intervention. By 2022, Renault-Nissan will have fully autonomous cars in the road, according to the Alliance 2022 plan. \u201cWe will all be coming to market with this by 2022,\u201d Ghosn said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see all of the carmakers with some level of autonomy.\u201d Audi, the luxury brand owned by Volkswagen AG, already has the most advanced autonomous car for sale in the A8. The car\u2019s Traffic Jam Pilot uses Lidar to see the road and lets drivers go completely hands-free at speeds up to 37 miles per hour. The company\u2019s future work promises to be much more advanced.\u00a0Audi, which is working with Nvidia, is targeting a fully autonomous car in 2020; the report from BNEF put\u00a0the date to reach Level 4 at\u00a02021. The company hasn\u2019t said whether it will be tested in a service or by its own engineers. Volkswagen also has an agreement with Aurora, the\u00a0startup whose founders have serious cred in the world of self-driving software. Its technical leaders are Urmson,\u00a0a founder of Google\u2019s self-driving effort, Sterling Anderson, who ran Tesla\u2019s Autopilot program, and Drew Bagnell, formerly a leader on Uber\u2019s autonomy team. The company has kept mum as to how it will go to market. BMW has a fleet of about 40 cars that can drive at Level 4 autonomy. The cars are driving around Munich and in California.\u00a0 The maker of Ultimate Driving Machines doesn\u2019t see selling the ultimate riding machine soon. The company is testing completely self-driving cars that they have developed with partner Intel Corp., which acquired sensor maker Mobileye, and with German parts maker Continental AG. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles\u00a0NV recently joined the partnership, which plans to have self-driving technology in production vehicles by 2021. The self-driving BMWs aren\u2019t ready for the highways, BMW Chief Finance Officer Nicolas Peter said\u00a0at a press event in Detroit. \u201cThis technology requires, from our perspective, some more time to have really fully automated cars on the road,\u201d Peter\u00a0said. There are currently about 1,000 people on the company\u2019s research and development\u00a0team. No one can count Toyota Motor Corp. out. The company started developing self-parking technology in 1999 and installed it in the Prius in Japan in 2003, enabling the car to park with no input from the driver. Toyota kept mum about capabilities until CES in January, when the company showed off a boxy shuttle concept called e-Palette. The Japanese automaker can make the self-driving shuttle in three sizes and it will\u00a0debut publicly at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 as a ride-hailing shuttle, said Gill Pratt, who runs Toyota Research Institute. Still, Toyota\u2019s message was one of patience. When Toyota tests its self-driving car in 2020, it may not have a driver\u2014or it may still have two people minding the front seats and the controls, Pratt said. He thinks a lot of carmakers and tech companies are hyping the true state of self-driving vehicles. \u201cWe will get there,\u201d Pratt said, \u201cbut I can\u2019t tell you when.\u201d Ford Motor Co. has been considered a laggard, especially since former CEO Mark Fields was fired last year, in part for not having a cohesive vision for autonomy and future mobility. But it\u2019s not fair to say Ford is flat-footed. The company gets its technology from Argo AI, the artificial intelligence company in Pittsburgh that Ford paid $1 billion\u00a0to take a significant stake last year. That investment brought in very good capabilities, said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst with Navigant Research. The Argo team has a strong lineage. The startup is the brainchild of Bryan Salesky, who was director of hardware development of what is now Waymo, and Peter Rander, who was engineering lead at the Uber Advanced Technologies Group. Salesky\u2019s experience dates back to the beginning of self-driving cars: He was senior software engineer on the winning team in the 2007 autonomous vehicle challenge funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa). Ford is now testing its third-generation Fusion sedan with Argo\u2019s technology. Even with Argo, however, Ford got a late start. When Ford bought the startup in February 2017, the company had few employees and Salesky spent a year staffing up.\u00a0 The plan is to have self-driving cars with Level 4 capability in 2021, said Sherif Markaby, Ford\u2019s vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification. The car will be purpose-built for autonomy that has no steering wheel or pedals. While Ford is a couple of years behind GM and Waymo, the company is experimenting with Domino\u2019s Pizza\u00a0to deliver pies and with Postmates to deliver other cargo. Ford is also preparing a Michigan factory to make autonomous vehicles. Volvo Cars AB has a goal of eliminating all injuries to passengers in its cars by 2020. That looks unlikely, but the company has 500 people developing its own self-driving technology. Right now, its Pilot Assist gives a driver 15 seconds with hands off the wheel, keeping the car in lane and managing\u00a0the distance to a vehicle ahead. The company is testing its technology with a few families in Gothenburg, Sweden. The tests will start with driver assistance technology and move up to more advanced systems over time. The automaker, owned by China\u2019s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, is developing more autonomous technology but won\u2019t be ready to go to market until 2021, according to a report from Navigant. Volvo is also working with Uber to develop autonomous systems for the XC90 SUVs. If you\u2019re coming from behind, might as well find a partner to usher things along. Korea\u2019s Hyundai Motors Co. will have an advanced safety system on the road this month that allows\u00a0drivers to take their hands off the wheel for 15 seconds. The company isn\u2019t ready to test truly self-driving cars, said Jinwoo Lee, vice president of Hyundai\u2019s Intelligent Safety Technology Center in Korea. To get there, Hyundai decided to work with Aurora, the technology startup that is working with VW, as well as with prolific partner Nvidia, maker of\u00a0artificial intelligence computing systems. Hyundai plans to test its autonomous system in a small city in 2021. \u201cWe take very conservative steps,\u201d Lee said in an interview. \u201cWe want to really test it and validate it.\u201d There are no current plans to test autonomous technology on public roads, and the company said it doesn\u2019t think it will be ready for market until 2025. Most traditional carmakers rushed to get a self-driving vehicle program once Waymo and Uber started working on it. Automakers feared that low-priced self-driving taxi services would replace car ownership and that they would just supply the hardware, just as Foxconn Technology Co.\u00a0makes the phone for Apple Inc.\u2014and Apple makes the real money selling content and services. Enter Fiat Chrysler. The automaker supplies the minivans to Waymo and helps integrate the technology, yet\u00a0has little development of its own. The company has started working with Intel and BMW but will not try to establish leadership alone. Ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies Inc. placed two huge bets on autonomous vehicles, first hiring top employees from Carnegie Robotics in 2015 and then acquiring the self-driving trucking startup Otto in 2016. But the program has been mired in controversy after a\u00a0high-profile lawsuit and a then fatal collision. Throughout 2015, Uber recruited top robotics talent from Carnegie Mellon as it built its Advanced Technologies Group in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. That group, led today by former Carnegie Robotics co-founder Eric Meyhofer, has spearheaded Uber\u2019s self-driving car program. In an effort to catapult Uber to the front of the autonomous-vehicle arms race, Uber acquired Otto Trucking in August 2016, buying a team filled with former employees of Alphabet\u2019s self-driving car unit. Less than a year later, Alphabet retaliated, filing a trade secrets lawsuit against Uber. The lawsuit revealed that Anthony Levandowski, who co-founded Otto after working on Google's self-driving car, then headed Uber's\u00a0driverless-car development effort,\u00a0had downloaded copies of work emails and sensitive files at Google.\u00a0Levandowski, along with Otto\u2019s other three co-founders, have all since left Uber. The ride-hailing company settled the lawsuit this year for $245 million in Uber equity, but not before the lawsuit distracted its leaders and placed a black mark on its autonomous program. Then in March, bad turned to tragic when a self-driving Uber struck and killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona. Uber quickly suspended all of its public autonomous-vehicle testing as it awaits the results of that investigation. If Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk can get the world\u2019s most powerful rocket off the ground with his company SpaceX, maybe he can also get cars to drive themselves. Tesla\u2019s Model S and X both have Autopilot, which can pass other cars and change lanes with no hands on the wheel. While it\u2019s not a fully autonomous system, it has given Tesla a lot of data about how its cars perform when driver-assistance software is engaged. Tesla has been under fire lately, after another person died in an accident while using Autopilot. Where things get murky is that Musk eschews the Lidar systems that most carmakers and tech companies are using. He says he wants to develop more advanced imaging to give his cars a much better pair of eyes. Musk wants to use cameras and develop image-recognition capabilities so cars can read signs and truly see the road ahead. He has said Tesla is taking the more difficult path, but if he can come up with a better system, he will have mastered true autonomy\u00a0without the bulky and expensive hardware that sits on top of rival self-driving cars. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have a whole bunch of expensive equipment, most of which makes the car expensive, ugly and unnecessary,\u201d Musk told analysts in February. \u201cAnd I think they will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage.\u201d Analysts from BNEF project that Tesla will be able to field Level 4 cars in 2020, although that timetable could be subject to change now that the company entered into a public spat with federal safety investigators over the fatal crash involving Autopilot. China\u2019s largest search engine has been developing self-driving software for five years.\u00a0Its Apollo software system for autonomous vehicles is open-source, and the company has invited all takers to work together to test cars and collect data. Baidu started testing the first version of the software in late 2017 on public roads and showed off version 2.0 at CES in Las Vegas in January. The Chinese government in March gave Baidu permission to test cars on 33 public roads in the suburbs of Beijing, making it first on the roads in China. The company\u2019s goal is to test the system in buses made by Chinese manufacturer King Long later this year\u00a0and, by 2020, to have autonomous vehicles capable of Level 3, meaning the car controls itself at highway speeds and tells the driver to take over in complex situations. Baidu\u2019s initial self-driving cars will be developed with China\u2019s Chery Automobile Co. Baidu also has a 2021 target to produce Level 4 autonomous cars in partnership with Chinese automaker BAIC Group. \u00a0 \u00a0","time":1525724551,"title":"Who\u2019s Winning the Self-Driving Car Race?","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/features\/2018-05-07\/who-s-winning-the-self-driving-car-race","label":0,"label_name":"biz-news"},{"by":"clumsysmurf","descendants":17,"id":17015837,"kids":"[17015861]","score":7,"text":"The Future Google\u2019s got our kids Joanna Petrone The video game Interland is part of Google's \u201cBe Internet Awesome\u201d curriculum aimed a \u201chelping kids be safe, confident explorers of the online world.\u201d It\u2019s set in a dreamy, blandly futuristic landscape rendered in the four hues of the Google logo. Numbing music cycles endlessly, like a shopping mall visit on a large dose of Klonopin. A cute avatar called an Internaut \u2014 an Android logo, thinly disguised \u2014 advances when the player correctly answers questions about oversharing, cyberbullying, and phishing scams. The game\u2019s release was met with positive reviews that completely miss the point. Interland may be fun and appealing, and may even serve a pedagogical purpose when it comes to drilling kids to recognize scammy or inappropriate online behavior. But even though there\u2019s nothing to buy, Interland is an ad. It doesn\u2019t hawk junk food or sneakers; rather Interland sells to kids the message that Google is a trustworthy arbiter of online safety and privacy. And Interland is only one of many ways this message has become increasingly embedded in K-12 school classrooms. According to a representative for the company, 25 million students worldwide use Chromebooks at school, which are generally more affordable alternatives to fully-fledged PCs or Macs. More than 80 million people use G Suite for Education, with 30 million teachers and students using Google Classroom, a management app that allows teachers to push out assignments and materials and collect student work. Companies selling products for schools to place in student hands is neither new nor, in itself, cause for concern. There is, however, an important difference between companies in the mold of, say, Houghton-Mifflin as opposed to one like Google. The former, presumably, is not trying to nurture cradle-to-grave consumers of social studies textbooks. The latter has a very strong interest not only in training the workforce of the future in G Suite, but also in forming positive and powerful brand associations in the minds of its littlest consumers. To get a sense of what all this brand exposure looks like, just spend an hour in my middle school classroom. On a typical day, students start class with a warm-up activity posted on Google Classroom. After we go over their answers and I teach a lesson, I might direct my students to open Google Docs and start writing. \u201cRemember to check Google Calendar and start studying for your next quiz! Oh, and don\u2019t forget to turn in your writing on Google Classroom before Thursday!\u201d I holler into the void as they pack up their bags. I\u2019ve learned from experience that I need to specify \u201cGoogle Classroom\u201d every time I give this direction; if I don\u2019t, if I just say \"Classroom,\" some students will submit their work on Classroom, some will stick it in their lowercase-c classroom notebooks, and at least one person will wander around the actual classroom while I am in the middle of an explanation, assignment in hand, wondering aloud where he was supposed to turn it in. \nThe Google Classroom app makes teachers\u2019 and administrations\u2019 lives very easy, but give Google a lot of access to kids who then can\u2019t learn not to trust it.            \n                dennizn \/ Shutterstock Kids learn both explicit and implicit lessons at school. A school can hang a banner to celebrate diversity, for instance, but if students encounter few people of color on the syllabus and in positions of authority in the school, they are likely to learn diversity doesn\u2019t really matter even with its importance spelled out in foot-high letters. Beyond datamining, some parents and privacy advocates have expressed concern that even when kids are explicitly taught how to safeguard their personal information online, school-mandated Chromebooks and Google accounts implicitly train kids to accept surveillance and hand over personal information. At the very least, how Google\u2019s presence and presentation in schools is shaping children\u2019s attitudes towards the company is a topic that deserves more scrutiny than it has received \u00a0in an educational moment that prizes all things STEM and tends to herald technology in the classroom as an unalloyed good. From one vantage point, classrooms like mine look like education technology success stories, with students\u2019 academic learning seamlessly interwoven with the workflow habits and productivity apps of all tomorrow\u2019s office workers. Using Google products, students can work collaboratively on files, use the internet for research, and acquire competency with the basics of personal computing. Districts often save substantial amounts of money by using Google\u2019s services in place of their own email servers and can provide more classroom access to computers using Chromebooks than they could using pricier alternatives. In a country where public education is cruelly underfunded, there\u2019s no mystery as to why teachers and districts are drawn to Google's cheap, often free, education technology and curriculum, but there needs to be an honest reckoning of its real price tag and robust public discussion about whether that is a cost worth paying. As the recent scrutiny of Facebook and Cambridge Analytica reminds us, placing tremendous faith in and few restrictions on powerful technology companies can have consequences that are difficult for users to grapple with until after serious damage is done. This is especially true of companies like Facebook and Google that possess tremendous amounts of our personal data and shape what information we see, all while deriving profit from ads. Google does not serve ads to K-12 student users on core G Suite for Education services, though it does collect and retain their data. If students eventually transfer the contents of their school Drive account to a personal Drive account, as they are often prompted to do before they graduate so they don\u2019t lose all record of their work, the information they created in school as a minor is no longer treated with special protections. Product placement on film, TV, and social media works because it capitalizes on our pre-existing affections and associations. Picture the elementary school classroom you loved best as a child: bulletin boards covered in primary-colored construction paper; displays labeled with the same die-cut, sans-serif paper letters used by every teacher in America. Did it sort of resemble, in a general way, the look of Google\u2019s logo? That logo, the childlike Google Doodles, the bulletin-board like interface of Classroom all share a peppy kindergarten aesthetic that blurs the distinction between the school and the company in a way that is perhaps visually pleasing but also imparts unearned to Google the positive associations that we hope children have for teachers and their school: feelings of safety, trustworthiness, care, and authority. The irony of a curriculum that teaches kids how to safeguard their privacy online yet is produced by a company known for its less-than-transparent use of personal data is a little on the nose, but the explicit lessons in Be Internet Awesome are too basic to be objectionable. The fundamentals of awesomeness, according to the program, include accounting for personal risk and propriety when posting online (\u201cShare with Care\u201d), recognizing scams (\u201cDon\u2019t Fall for Fake\u201d), setting strong passwords (\u201cSecure Your Secrets\u201d), opposing online bullying (\u201cIt\u2019s Cool to Be Kind,\u201d whose Nick Lowe reference is wasted on the young), and recognizing when to go to a trusted adult (\u201cWhen in Doubt, Talk it Out\u201d). Pragmatic as the content is, it also transmits implicit lessons about the Google brand, whose brand colors, icons, and font are slathered over everything from student handouts to classroom posters to, for some reason, paper doll patterns for making your very own Internaut. Be Internet Awesome implicitly signals to students that Google is synonymous with privacy and safety. By focusing solely on personal choices, the program suggests that the power to protect personal information lies entirely within one\u2019s own hands and locates responsibility for doing so with the individual. There\u2019s nothing wrong with telling students not to send money to someone claiming to be a Nigerian prince but for most people, most of the time, there is greater danger in all the usual and perfectly legal ways of persuading us to part with our money, just as the greater threat to our privacy, as anyone compromised in the Experian hack can tell you, comes not from, or not only from, crappy passwords but from numerous \u00a0ways we are tracked without our permission or knowledge. If a goal, ultimately, is not just to prevent kids from downloading viruses onto school devices but to teach them how to protect themselves from larger corporate interests that may use them for their data, classroom materials that subtly advance a particular narrative about the company that made them undermine that end. Interland is especially egregious, meeting the criteria for what Common Sense Media, in its 2014 research paper, terms an \u2018advergame,\u2019 an online game that \u201cinvolves a user playing with branded items. . . or playing in a heavily branded environment.\u201d Advergames are psychologically powerful because they \u201cinvolve the child for a longer period of time than TV ads do, and the experience of playing the game is more immersive and may promote identification with the product.\u201d \u00a0Additionally, \u201cby their very nature, advergames blur the boundaries between entertainment and advertising content. . . [and] the mental state of flow some gamers get into while playing also may contribute to a blurring of boundaries.\u201d Many school children, especially early elementary-school aged ones, are yet to reach the stage of development where they are able to recognize the motivations of other people, let alone understand why an abstract corporate entity might have an interest in portraying itself in a particular way. Young kids can\u2019t recognize ads as such; even adolescents are not attuned to rhetoric and manipulation in the same way as adults and need instruction in this area. This, of course, as any parent who has ever raced a cart down the cereal aisle knows, is what makes kids such a credible, vulnerable, and lucrative audience. As the saying goes, if you are not paying for the service you\u2019re using, the product is you \u2014 your personal information, your attention, or, in this case, your children\u2019s. None of this is to say that Google\u2019s classroom technology is not a useful tool. It can provide new avenues for educators and students to research, collaborate, and make real-world connections. Even the Be Internet Awesome curriculum speaks to a real need schools have to prepare students for life in a digital world though they lack resources, including teacher expertise, to do so. The issue isn\u2019t that Google has nothing of value to offer schools \u2014 clearly, it has \u2014 but rather at what price are we buying it. If it\u2019s too steep we might want to recall lessons from our own educations, not about how to be savvy, polished consumers of technology, but about how to be citizens.

A basic packing list app was built in: Surely you\u2019re familiar with one or more of the aforementioned systems, and now you can leverage that knowledge to better understand many others. It\u2019s your chance to see what all the buzz is about, and honestly, how similar all these state systems really are. To portray these systems in a terse and understandable form, the chosen app is a simple packing list app with only the ability to add and clear. To illustrate state jumping the wire, the ADD\/CLEAR is one component, and the LIST is a secondary component in all examples. Even the two main components (adding\/listing) have been abstracted to an imported library, leaving only fundamental code in order to emphasize state choice(s). The code is meant to be minimalistic. The code for each of these systems can be found in React and React Native. Use the above repo to personally dive into each of those systems and check them out! \ud83d\udd25 If you want code, check the GitHub, if you want opinions, continue into this very long description below. Here I jump into the differences between each item in the museum, and that which makes it unique. If you\u2019ve got some strong opinions, or experiences, please share them in the comments. I\u2019m also interested in giving this report as a fun-filled conference talk. Here\u2019s the most basic structure of state management, it depends only on the fundamental understanding of components and their encapsulation. In many ways, this is a great example for beginners in React. Explicitly raising state to a root component that all components are children of identifies the props vs. state relationship. As an application grows, explicit connections down into components would be more and more complex and fragile, which is why this is not commonly used. https:\/\/reactjs.org\/docs\/context.html There\u2019s been a lot of buzz about the updates to Context. In fact, the final form of Context in 16.x feels a bit like a state management system itself. For simplicity, the context allows for provider and a consumer. All children of a provider will have access to the values applied there. All non-children will see the context defaults. The following graph explains such lineage. On a second, and very opinionated note, I\u2019m not a fan of the consumption syntax structure. Clearly, it\u2019s a function that is the child of Consumer, but it feels like it violates JSX while mega-overloading all use cases of braces. A pedantic issue, but the readability of code should always factor into API, and on this front, Context starts to feel a bit dirty. https:\/\/github.com\/reactjs\/react-redux I\u2019ll dare say at the time of this writing Redux is the most popular state management tool, and therefore the most attacked. Writing a solution in Redux took many files, and almost double the lines of code. But to Redux\u2019s defense, it\u2019s simple and flexible. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with Redux, it\u2019s a functional approach to state management that provides time-travel and clean state management in a form like a reducer function. Dan Abramov\u2019s video explaining redux has been watched many times. In short, it\u2019s like having someone shout commands in your app (Actions) which are projected via Action Creators. Data managers in your app (Reducers) hear those shouts, and can optionally act on them. I love my pirate ship analogy, so shouting \u201cMAN_OVERBOARD\u201d can tell your crew counter to subtract the staff by one, the accountant to re-split the treasure, and the guy swabbing the deck can just ignore it because he doesn\u2019t care. I like this analogy, because shouting is a powerful way to manage all corners of your app, and in larger applications, noisy. Combine this with no way to handle side-effects and the need to glue on an immutable structure to make it all work, Redux is the bill-by-hour developer\u2019s friend. https:\/\/github.com\/mobxjs\/mobx-react MobX is one of the EASIEST state managers to get started with. Open the readme, and follow along and you\u2019ll have things running in no time. It feels like mutable JS, and it really kind of is. The only part that might throw you for a loop is the decorators like @observer on classes. Though odd, they kind of clean up the code a bit. Be sure to checkout Nader\u2019s blog post highlighting some more advanced topics on switching to MobX. In summation, MobX was one of the smallest and simplest tools to add! https:\/\/github.com\/jamiebuilds\/unstated Unstated was as easy as MobX. Much like MobX felt like mutable JavaScript, Unstated felt like adding more React code. I actually feel that Unstated feels more like React than Context did. It\u2019s simple, you create a container, and inside that container, you manage state. Simple known functions like setState exist inside the state container. It\u2019s not just an apt name; it\u2019s an apt React based manager. I\u2019m not sure how well it scales or handles middleware etc. but if you\u2019re a beginner to state management MobX and Unstated are the simplest tools to get up and running! https:\/\/github.com\/mobxjs\/mobx-state-tree Yes, this is VERY different from vanilla MobX. It\u2019s a common misconception. Even my co-workers try to shorten the title down to \u201cMobX,\u201d and I\u2019m always pushing MST as an alternative instead. With that being said, it\u2019s important to note MobX-State-Tree sports all the great features of Redux + reselect + Side-effect management and more all in one opinionated bundle with less code. In this small example, the only thing that\u2019s obvious is the terse syntax. The lines of code are barely bigger than our original MobX example. Both share that succinct decorator syntax. Though it takes a bit of time to really get all the benefits out of MobX-State-Tree. The most important note is that if you came from ActiveRecord or some other kind of ORM, MobX-State-Tree feels like a clean data model with normalized relations. This is a great state management tool for an application that will scale. https:\/\/github.com\/apollographql\/react-apollohttps:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/appsync\/ If you haven\u2019t jumped on the GraphQL train, you\u2019re missing out. Apollo GraphQL + AppSync is a great way to manage your state, AND handle offline, AND handle fetching API, AND handle setting up a GraphQL server. It\u2019s a serious solution. Many have projected GraphQL to effectively \u201csolve\u201d the state debate. In a lot of ways that\u2019s easy, and in a lot of ways, that\u2019s hard. Not everyone is ready to use a GraphQL server, but if you are, then AppSync is an easy way to handle all your data in your DynamoDB. It takes more time\/energy to get this up and running, but with clear benefits. In my example, I don\u2019t really use all the bells and whistles. You can see the delay as the data awaits from the server, and I\u2019m not using subscriptions to get updates. This example could get better. But it\u2019s as simple as wrapping the config with the components. Tadaaaaa! The rest is history. Special note: Please be careful what you put in the packing list in this example, as it\u2019s shared. https:\/\/github.com\/MicheleBertoli\/react-automata This is a strange one in the group. In many ways, you\u2019re wondering how setState is involved, and the answer is simple. The idea of breaking state down into a state-machine is very different from most state management systems. By creating an xstate machine config, you handle how state gets passed, called, and identified. Therefore, you must identify ALL states your app can be in, and ALL ways it can move from one state to another. Much like dispatching an action in Redux, you have to transition to another state on a given event. It\u2019s not a full state management system; it\u2019s merely a state-machine for your state management. Here\u2019s the chart created by our statechart Exciting benefits come from using statecharts. Firstly, you can be protected from transitions you don\u2019t want. For instance, you can\u2019t transition to \u201cloaded\u201d state without first typing text. This stops empty adds to our packing list. Secondly, all transitions of state can be automatically generated and tested. With one simple command, multiple snapshots of state are generated. CAVEAT: On React Native I had to yarn add path to satisfy some unused import in a dependency. This was a sneaky gotcha for native only https:\/\/github.com\/FormidableLabs\/freactal\/ Of course, we\u2019ll feature the awesome work of Formidable Labs. Freactal is a very advanced example and states it can replace redux, MobX, reselect, redux-loop, redux-thunk, redux-saga and more. Though this was probably the most difficult one for me to setup, I still see it has great value. More examples would have helped. Special thanks to Ken Wheeler who agreed to answer any questions I had while reading through the docs. The final code is succinct and straightforward. It feels a bit like the Context syntax in the end. I especially like the use of name-spacing effects separately from state, and computer though there\u2019s not much stopping you from taking this convention to other libs. https:\/\/github.com\/msteckyefantis\/reduxx ReduxX, while probably having a bit of trouble in SEO, is still a pretty cool name. ReduxX reads pretty well as in some ways it reminds me a bit of the charisma from Unstated, as we\u2019re using react-styled verbiage to set and mutate state. One aspect that might seem alien, is the state is retrieved with getState as a function. This feels a bit like keychain access, and I wonder if there could be some certs\/crypto mixed in easily? Food for thought. I see there\u2019s obscureStateKeys: true which will swap keys out for GUIDs. Security-wise this library might have some interesting advantages. As for how to use it, Set and Get via keys. That\u2019s it! If you\u2019re not worried about middleware, and you\u2019re familiar with keychain globals, you already know ReduxX. Special thanks to the author Mikey Stecky-Efantis for providing this example! I\u2019m sure there are other state managers out there which are being sorely under-represented here, and if you know them, please send a PR to the public repo. I\u2019ll happily accept contributions so that we can all benefit. I\u2019ll even update this blog post as new systems are added. So please, file tickets, and more importantly contribute!

The study led by Bristol University said health service spending on such firms doubled between 2010 and 2014. And analysis of spending by 120 NHS trusts suggests that the more they spend on management consultants, the less efficient they became. Every \u00a3100,000 spent on such firms was associated with extra costs of around \u00a3900, the research found - amounting to losses of around \u00a311,000 for the average trust. And these did not include the actual spending on such firms, with the average trust spending \u00a31.2m a year on management consultants - the salary of\u00a0\u00a035 senior nurses - the study found. The study, published in the journal Policy and Politics, details how NHS yearly expenditure on management consultants almost doubled from \u00a3313 million in 2010 to \u00a3640 million in 2014. The experts from the universities of Bristol, Seville and Warwick Business School linked data from 120 hospital trusts in England, between 2009\/10 and 2012\/13, \u00a0to measures used to track efficiency. \u00a0 They said that spending on management consultants was associated with inefficiency equivalent to an average annual loss of \u00a310,600 a year for each hospital trust. This did not include the money actually spent on consultancy, with individual trusts spending up to \u00a35.6 million per year. Andrew Sturdy, professor in management at the University of Bristol, said: \"Our research has clearly shown that management consultants are not only failing to improve efficiency in the NHS but, in most cases, making the situation worse. \"Data shows that it's a system-wide problem. This is money which, many argue, could be better spent on medical services or internal management expertise. \"From the study data we can only speculate on what lies behind these findings. One possibility is that consulting projects are highly disruptive, especially if the demand for them has been generated artificially by sophisticated selling, backstage deal-making and revolving doors between politicians, regulators, healthcare managers and civil servants.\" Professor Ian Kirkpatrick, from Warwick Business School, added: \"Given financial constraints facing the NHS, an obvious question is whether it is appropriate to continue using external consulting advice at the current level. \"This study highlights the need for organisations to be more circumspect in decisions about whether and how to use management consultants.\" An NHS Improvement spokesman said latest figures suggest NHS trusts are spending \u00a3263 million a year on management consultants, a \u00a3150 million drop since 2013. He said: \u00a0\"We are working with all trusts on reducing their costs, which includes spending less on management consultants; and have had some success. \"Since 2013, trusts have reduced their spending on management consultants by \u00a3150 million, which is a significant improvement on the past. \"In future, we will continue to work with trusts on keeping their consultancy spending to a minimum, and on commissioning it better,\u201d he said. \u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018 We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.

Integrating solar cells into roofing material wasn\u2019t in any way a new idea, but Tesla\u2019s solar roof tiles innovated\u00a0by making the solar cells undetectable\u00a0from a street view while still capturing sunlight. Now a new patent obtained by Tesla and released last week shows how the company made it happen.\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n When unveiling the new product, Musk said that there was\u00a0a shocking amount of technology in the tiles. They are using new\u00a0solar cells developed with Panasonic and they had to develop a new complex connector technology to link all the tiles in an efficient way that wouldn\u2019t take too much time to install. But for the\u00a0aesthetics, they had to find a way to make the tiles look normal from a street view while still leaving the solar cells visible from a birdseye view in order for them to catch the sun. They had to achieve all that without losing too much cell efficiency. Tesla claims to have done it with about 98% of the efficiency of regular solar cells in solar panels. Here\u2019s a look at a street angle (left) versus a birdseye view (right) of the solar roof tiles:  The day before they unveiled the product, Tesla applied for a patent on the technology behind it and the application was made public last week. In short, Tesla developed a new glass with\u00a0louvers that reflect that light in a way that makes it look opaque at a lower angle when combined with a backsheet layer while still remaining transparent for the sunlight above. Here are two figures from the patent application:  Here\u2019s Tesla\u2019s more technical description of the system from the patent application: \u201cA solar panel includes a backsheet layer, a bottom encapsulant layer adjacent the backsheet layer, a plurality of photovoltaic cells adjacent the bottom encapsulant layer, a top encapsulant layer adjacent the plurality of photovoltaic cells having a plurality of louvers constructed therein to block side view of the plurality of photovoltaic cells, and a top layer adjacent the top encapsulant layer.\u201d The patent application also describes different ways that they can use the technology to give different visible colors and textures to the tiles. I am not going to lie,\u00a0a lot of it is extremely technical and went over my\u00a0head, but here\u2019s the patent application in full if you want to take a deep dive: \n Tesla is a transportation and energy company. It sells vehicles under its 'Tesla Motors' division and stationary battery pack for home, commercial and utility-scale projects under its 'Tesla Energy' division. Tesla and SolarCity developed a solar roof system that integrates the solar cells and modules inside the structure of the roof rather than just panels on a roof.  \n@FredericLambert\n Fred is the Editor in Chief and Main Writer at Electrek.

I have co-authored a single book in 2017 called Cloud Native Infrastructure for O\u2019Reilly Media. Many people have asked me what it was like so I will attempt to explain the process, time investment, and financial incentive here. This was my experience. If you have written a book, or would like to, I promise your experience will be different. Nonetheless, I hope you can learn something from the things I learned. The process was about what I expected. I was introduced to Brian, our first of three editors, from someone I knew who was already writing their third book. They thought I might be a good fit for what they were looking for so they made the introduction. I thought about it for a couple weeks and then submitted a formal book proposal which entailed filling out a Word document template and emailing it to the editor. I didn\u2019t hear back for about 3 weeks and then, after a follow-up email, heard the proposal was approved. After a kick-off call it was suggested that I find a co-author to help write the book. I had a week to find one and then needed to sign a contract with O\u2019Reilly for dates and deliverables. I interviewed a few people and Kris Nova and I complemented each others skills perfectly for the content we wanted to cover in the book. She agreed it sounded like a good topic and she was excited to take on the challenge. The contract seemed fairly standard and focused around content ownership and royalties split. The default split between authors is 50\/50 which we stuck with. The contract stipulated that Kris and I own the copyright for the content, but O\u2019Reilly has exclusive rights to use the content any way they see fit throughout the world now and in the future for the duration of the copyright. Once the contract was signed there was a steady pace of work as we both figured out how to lay out content and what we should write about. O\u2019Reilly provides a platform called Atlas for writing which is quite good. You write in plain text AsciiDoc and then O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Atlas platform can generate a PDF, or other formats, via the web interface or API. We both used atlas-cli to generate PDFs as we wrote. Generating the PDFs was a good feedback loop on the content. It helped make sure formatting was right and also allowed us to take a step back to read what we wrote. Atlas works as a remote git repo but Kris and I chose to mostly work out of a private GitHub repo. We originally envisioned making pull requests to collaborate on each other's content but that didn\u2019t happen as much as expected. Atlas has editing tools and some additional features available but we mostly just used it as a git remote URL. On March 1st we were assigned our cover animal which Kris and I named Andy O\u2019Connor the Andean Condor. We were pretty excited to see the cover for the first time even if the subtitle went through multiple revisions. We didn\u2019t get to pick the animal or the picture. We were told up front we wouldn\u2019t get to pick the animal so we knew what to expect. We were also told that Tyrannosaurus Rex and unicorns are not allowed. We kept writing until the 1\/2 draft was due in early June. We turned it in and got less feedback than we expected, but it was still good to have a fresh set of eyes looking at it. We didn\u2019t like what we had created. We had written almost 6 chapters and threw away 3 of them. The first two were heavily edited and the remaining chapter was trimmed down significantly and turned into an appendix. We had some more planning meetings and came up with a revised outline that we submitted to our editor for review. By this time we were on our 2nd editor who wasn\u2019t very familiar with the project so we got very little feedback and went with what we had. We kept writing with minimal interactions with our editor until we were really close to needing the full draft due. I had sent select chapters to friends to look at and tried to incorporate the changes they suggested. The first Tuesday of September the full draft was due and then went into a review process. There were technical reviewers we were able to suggest but mostly O\u2019Reilly pulled from a pool of their trusted reviewers. We got minimal feedback from most of them (a survey form) and one returned notes on the PDF. We had a week to make edits. During this time the draft was made available as a preview on Safari books. In retrospect I wish we had posted preview chapters sooner which was something our first editor suggested, but we were both too embarrassed to follow through. It wasn\u2019t enough feedback for me so I reached out to more people and sent them chapters looking for someone to tell me it sucks and why. Luckily, I found someone who would give me the harsh feedback I wanted and I had about 3 days to incorporate their changes into the book before it went off to post production. The last push was very difficult and stressful. There were a lot of big changes on the last weekend which was a risk, but I think in the end made the book better. The final weekend we moved some chapters around and wrote a chapter from scratch for content we felt was missing. Post production was handled by non-technical, professional editors for grammar, spelling, and general readability. I believe the first PDF came back with more than 1300 edits. Overall there were more than 2000 changes made during post. I later found out this amount of edits is fairly standard for our book length. We had about 3 weeks of emailing large, heavily notated PDFs back and forth which was no fun compared to the plain text git workflow of writing. Post production took about a month to complete and then the book went off for printing. At the same time it was posted on Safari Books Online and immediately available. We each received 6 copies of the book in the mail shortly after it was available for sale. All in all I worked from Feb\u200a\u2014\u200aOct for roughly 5 nights a week at 2\u20133 hours per night. I also worked about 3 weekends non-stop when a draft or final edits were due. Roughly I\u2019d say I worked about 500 hours total. That was only my time and doesn\u2019t include Kris\u2019. I was lucky to have a co-author to share the load. Some people have asked how I found motivation to keep writing. I\u2019m a fairly driven individual and the deadlines in the contract were enough for me to put in time most nights. I wasn\u2019t motivated enough to meet the original 250 page goal, but I was happy with the content we were able to cover and how much we accomplished. Kris had a different creative process than I did. She was better at mulling over a topic in her head and putting it all down in one sitting; often the week before one of the deadlines. This made me nervous on multiple occasions and was probably the biggest thing I stressed about. Everything was submitted and completed on time, but I would suggest you have a sense for how you and your co-author work together at the beginning instead of the week before a project deadline. Throughout the writing process I felt like I finished writing multiple times. Once when the final draft was due, once when technical reviewer\u2019s feedback was incorporated, and once at the end of the post editing process. In each case it meant we got to take a break from writing while we waited for feedback. At the end of final edits I was done (contractually and mentally). I had read through the entire book at least three times and much of the content was starting to lose meaning. After sending the final edited PDF I wanted to stress about missing an edit before going to bed, but I was too tired to care. O\u2019Reilly provides an affiliate program which was terrible to set up and in the end hardly worth the time. You get a cut from all sales that go through your link but I have never received any money from affiliate book sales. The only money I got was when someone used my link and then bought a ticket to an O\u2019Reilly conference. To date only one person has done that and I received $200. If anyone is looking to buy tickets to Velocity or OSCON feel free to click the O\u2019Reilly book links at www.cnibook.info and then buy a conference ticket. \ud83d\ude0a I attempted to set up an affiliate program for Amazon but my application was denied. Amazon offers an author central site to create a 1998 inspired author profile page and an out of date book sale statistics and rankings. I\u2019m really not sure the point of creating the Amazon author information outside of claiming the book(s) you author and confirming that you have a terrible book rank. While setting up these accounts is when I created the cnibook.info website and @cnibook twitter handle. Luckily the website is a static page hosted on GitHub so there is no recurring costs. The twitter account I still maintain but has minimal interactions. The landing page was a valuable use of my time as it gave a URL to point people to for anyone searching for the book or wanting more information. I would suggest anyone writing a book spend a night to register a domain and set one up. I launched it on August 31, 2017 and it has over 4,600 visits which is terrible by most website standards but good as a place to funnel users for info. During AWS Re:Invent I decided it would be fun to try a Twitter campaign to try and get some interest in the book. I set a limit of $50 which bought 7,648 impressions (people saw the tweet). This includes 161 engagements (clicked on the tweet, RT\u2019d, or favorited), and 37 clicks (clicked the link). I promoted the tweet above and I don\u2019t think it was worth the money. I don\u2019t believe it generated any sales and cost $.31 per engagement. After that campaign I had another tweet that was retweeted by a friend (I didn\u2019t ask them to do it) with a lot of followers and it had more engagements than the paid for, promoted tweet. The book was originally supposed to be 250 pages and would have cost $59.99. Instead it was only 160 pages and cost $39.99. Because we co-authored the book we each got 5% of revenue for physical books and 12.5% for ebooks and digital access (10% and 25% for individual authors). This breaks down to we each get $.99 for a physical book and $.46 for an ebook. Safari Books Online (SBO) pays based on how many pages are viewed and how many people have added the book to their personal bookshelf (I never knew before why that was a thing). So far I have received $539 over 5 months for SBO. The payments come on the last day of the month after the month when O\u2019Reilly receives payment for the sale. If you bought a book on February 1st, $.99 was added to the check I received on March 31st. From December through March the book has sold 1337 copies. I have no idea how well other books in this category sell. This total also includes 2 book signings at conferences that were sponsored by the CNCF (Thank you!) which was roughly 150 physical books total. On average, the book has sold 222 copies per month which is greatly skewed by the first month which had 930 sales. The last month (March) had 34 physical book sales. I suspect that number will go down even more over the next few months. Sponsorships was an unexpected source of income. We have been lucky enough to have 3 sponsors so far. The sponsor pays O\u2019Reilly for exclusive rights to provide a PDF and optional print version of the book. The company gets to put a forward in the book that Kris, me, and an O\u2019Reilly editor approve. Once the sponsor completes their contract with O\u2019Reilly they can do whatever they want with the books. Usually, the PDF gets put behind a web form so you fill out your email address and the company uses it for marketing services and getting customer leads. Physical books are usually given away at conferences where they can scan badges. I have no idea if this model is financially viable for the companies but I would assume so. I\u2019ve asked for download numbers but was never provided any and the sponsors are not contractually obligated to give numbers. I\u2019m not sure how many books get sponsors, but it helps a lot with raising awareness of the book because companies have more of a presence on social media and have budgets for advertising. Each full book sponsorship for one month nets me $3,705 and partial sponsorships give an amount based on percentage of the book sponsored (e.g. 5 chapters in a 10 chapter book is 50% sponsored). That\u2019s much better than I expected because a one month full sponsorship is more than all other sales combined. I\u2019m not going to say exactly what percentage I get from the sponsorship simply because I don\u2019t want to disclose how much any of these 3rd parties pay and their finances are not my business to disclose. There are also some other sponsorships that I think count as ebook sales but I never got a clear answer how royalties work for those. Book licensing incurs a small payment but I\u2019m unclear how that is used. From my statements, three people have licensed the book or excerpts from it which has netted me $2.37. My April 2018 statement (sales from December\u200a\u2014\u200aMarch) says I\u2019ve made $11,554.15 which roughly breaks down to $23 per hour for the estimated 500 hours of work. Without the three sponsorships that would have been $5.29 per hour. Luckily that number only gets better with time. I\u2019ve heard 2nd editions are a better rate per hour because they have less time investment with similar sales as the original, but I don\u2019t have any experience. Going into this project I had a rough estimate in my head to make about $2000\u20133000 so this is much better than I expected. Set your expectations accordingly. I\u2019m extremely happy with the how things have turned out. We\u2019ve got a lot of great feedback and some average reviews on Amazon (please leave us a review!). I\u2019m grateful that people are reading it and I hope it\u2019s helping them in some way. We worked hard and wanted to help engineers get better at running infrastructure. I learned that you can\u2019t just write a book and expect it to sell. There needs to be a lot of effort (a.k.a. budget and time) in marketing and it takes more than just individuals with twitter accounts to get the word out. It has been humbling to have friends and organizations help us promote the book and even pay to put the book in people\u2019s hands. So far I know of only one grammatical mistake, which is a win in my book (pun intended). The book has provided a few other opportunities that I probably wouldn\u2019t have had. So far I\u2019ve done a couple podcast interviews, spoken at a few events, did one webinar, and have had a few opportunities for more writing projects with O\u2019Reilly (some of which I\u2019ve taken). Would I write another book? Not for the foreseeable future. I would like to update Cloud Native Infrastructure to keep it fresh with current industry trends, but another book from scratch is not a year long project I\u2019d be looking forward to at this time. I\u2019m very proud of the work we accomplished and glad we wrote it. I can\u2019t think of anything else I would have done with that time that would have been better spent. I\u2019d love it if you bought a copy of the book using the affiliate links at www.cnibook.info and if you\u2019ve already read it please let us know what you think. We\u2019re available on twitter rothgar and krisnova. We also love pictures of the book with your pets. It makes us smile. \ud83d\ude04 I hope this has given you some insights into what it takes to write a book and what you can expect if you do it. By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out. Trying new things. Breaking stuff.

Jay Leno joking around on stage, an overjoyed Bill Gates dancing with his team to the sound of the Rolling Stones, a huge banner promoting the innovative Start Menu and everyone just having a blast like it was their last day on earth. It was the best party you\u2019ve ever missed. BUT WHAT IS WINDOWS 95? It was so simply put that one could not help but love it. No beating around the bush, the goal of Windows 95 was clear. You would be able to have more fun, be more efficient at work and have an easier life dealing with your personal computer. This kind of honesty is now extinct and even if products are advertised as the best you\u2019ve ever seen, you never know what you\u2019re really going to get in the end. Take the launch of Microsoft\u2019s latest version of their operating system, Windows 10, for instance. No music, no comedians, no party, no fun and a lot of dubious statements. THE AMAZING START BUTTON Can you imagine clicking on a single button and having all the available options displayed? This was the real game changer and the reason why the Microsoft team thought it was cool to hang a Start Button banner on top of their presentation. This really was an huge improvement concerning user experience, before anyone thought it was something worth the investment. It picked something as complex and hard to understand as MS-DOS and turned it into a simple interface. There was an enormous effort to make sure that everyone would be able to use a computer with Windows 95 and it did not disappoint. How great would it be if someone could take your washing machine and turn all the available options into something you could actually understand? Making MS-DOS (or Windows 3.0.) understandable was almost as hard as that. I\u2019m not saying we should solve every UI and UX issue with a start menu, but most web designs out there could surely learn a lot from how Windows 95 solved so many problems by thinking about how target users would deal with their product. Maybe some big corporations out there should start with simplification and honesty, instead of adding dating features. EVERYTHING IN THE POINT OF YOUR MOUSE As a robotic voice explains in the Windows 95 demonstration, the whole idea was to reduce the number of steps needed to take any given action. Want to open Word? Start menu. Need to close it? X button. Want to resume your work? Recent documents tab. Clicking is the end itself, not a mean to get there. All 19MBs of Windows 95 consisted on useful tools that you could expect from a computer. There was no Cry Translator or Electric Shaver app\u200a\u2014\u200awonders of the modern day, available on any smartphone\u200a\u2014\u200aas it was focused on a few objectives only. Imagine if such a strange object as a phone that could only make calls existed. That would be the equivalent of Windows 95 on a computer back then. It had everything you ever needed from it, without the unnecessary waste of space. As human kind evolved, such objectivity was lost. Cars now come with perfume dispensers, TVs can be stored like newspapers and even your toaster can access the Internet. Windows 95 main objective was to allow you to use a computer easily. And it did just that. CROUCHING TIGGER, HIDDEN FEATURES All this objectivity doesn\u2019t mean that Microsoft didn\u2019t have some cards up their sleeve. However, it was nothing like hiding settings that enable you to keep your information private and secure or stopping you from unsubscribing from boring services. Sure, Windows 95 could be very vulnerable online, but while you were being hacked, you could be happy knowing that there was no hidden feature that would have helped you in that situation. It\u2019s all about transparency, which is something that we are lacking in our modern days. We suspect that our phones are tracking us, that Facebook is selling our data, that webcams are spying for the FBI and that lizard people are running America. Never for a second we doubted Windows 95. MR. GATES, I DON\u2019T FEEL SO GOOD\u2026 All good things come to an end and Windows 95 was shut down for good in 2001. While, obviously, it\u2019s not a viable operating system nowadays, the first real attempt of Microsoft to build a computer system available to everyone left a valuable legacy. What really stands out are the main qualities that Windows 95, as a product, had and that are not common nowadays. It had a memorable launch, it was honest regarding its objectives, focused on the user, objective and transparent. It\u2019s really easy to disregard the importance of these basic concepts, but in fact, they are behind most issues we currently face with web products. I\u2019m not trying to compare operating systems with social media or mobile applications, but notions such as transparency and objectivity are transversal and equally important. Windows 95 was not perfect and it\u2019s just an example from a whole lot of products that were launched more than 20 years ago, but not being more than it needed to be was its greatest quality, one that isn\u2019t very common nowadays. \u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014 At Imaginary Cloud, we simplify complex systems, delivering interfaces that users love with our own Product Design Process.

This is\u00a0not an\u00a0unbiased comparison -- but those are no\u00a0fun anyway. The\u00a0scenario: two applications, using Massive.js to\u00a0store and\u00a0retrieve data. Massive is\u00a0closely coupled to\u00a0Postgres by\u00a0design. Specializing lets it\u00a0take advantage of\u00a0features which only exist in\u00a0some or\u00a0no\u00a0other relational databases to\u00a0streamline data access in\u00a0a\u00a0lighter, more \"JavaScripty\" way than a\u00a0more traditional object-relational mapper. It's great for\u00a0getting things done, since the\u00a0basics are easy and\u00a0for the\u00a0complicated stuff where you'd be\u00a0writing SQL anyway.... you write SQL, you store it\u00a0in\u00a0one central place for\u00a0reuse, and\u00a0the API makes running it\u00a0simple. Where Massive is\u00a0less useful is\u00a0if\u00a0you have to\u00a0support another RDBMS. This is, ideally, something you know about up\u00a0front. Anyway: things happen, and\u00a0sometimes you find yourself having to\u00a0answer the\u00a0question \"what's it\u00a0going to\u00a0look like if\u00a0we\u00a0need to\u00a0run these applications with light but tightly coupled data layers on\u00a0MySQL?\" Not good, was the\u00a0obvious answer, but less immediately obvious was how not good. I\u00a0knew there were some things Postgres did that MySQL didn't, but I\u00a0also knew there were a\u00a0ton of\u00a0things I'd just never tried in\u00a0the\u00a0latter. So\u00a0as\u00a0I\u00a0got to\u00a0work on\u00a0this, I\u00a0started keeping notes. Here's everything I\u00a0found. Now that we're all basically over the\u00a0collective hallucination of\u00a0a\u00a0\"schemaless\" future, arguably the\u00a0most important aspect of\u00a0data storage is\u00a0how information is\u00a0modeled in\u00a0a\u00a0database. Postgres and\u00a0MySQL are both relational databases, grouping records in\u00a0strictly-defined tables. But there's a\u00a0lot of\u00a0room for\u00a0variation within that theme. First things first: \"schema\" doesn't always mean the\u00a0same thing. To\u00a0MySQL, \"schema\" is\u00a0synonymous with \"database\". For\u00a0Postgres, a\u00a0\"schema\" is\u00a0a\u00a0namespace within a\u00a0database, which allows you to\u00a0group tables, views, and\u00a0functions together without having to\u00a0break them apart into different databases. MySQL's simplicity in\u00a0this respect is\u00a0ameliorated by\u00a0its offering cross-database queries: With Postgres, you can work across schemas, but if\u00a0you need to\u00a0query information in\u00a0a\u00a0different database, that's a\u00a0job for... Foreign data wrappers let Postgres talk to\u00a0practically anything that represents information as\u00a0discrete records. You can create a\u00a0\"foreign table\" in\u00a0a\u00a0Postgres database and\u00a0SELECT or\u00a0JOIN it\u00a0like any other table -- only under the\u00a0hood, it's actually reading a\u00a0CSV, talking to\u00a0another DBMS, or\u00a0even querying a\u00a0REST API. It's a\u00a0powerful enough feature that NoSQL stalwart MongoDB sneakily built their BI Connector on\u00a0top of\u00a0Postgres with foreign data wrappers. You don't even need to\u00a0know C\u00a0to\u00a0write a\u00a0new FDW when Multicorn lets you do\u00a0it\u00a0in\u00a0Python! Oracle and\u00a0SQL Server both have some functionality for\u00a0registering external data sources, but Postgres' offering is\u00a0the\u00a0most extensible I'm aware of. MySQL, besides the\u00a0inter-database query support mentioned above, has nothing. Inheritance is\u00a0more commonly thought of\u00a0as\u00a0an\u00a0attribute of\u00a0object-oriented programming languages rather than databases, but Postgres is\u00a0technically an\u00a0ORDBMS or\u00a0object-relational database management system. So\u00a0you can have a\u00a0table cities with columns name and\u00a0population, and\u00a0a\u00a0table capitals which inherits the\u00a0definition of\u00a0cities but adds an\u00a0of_country column only relevant, of\u00a0course, for\u00a0capital cities. If\u00a0you SELECT from cities, you get rows from capitals -- they're cities too! You can of\u00a0course SELECT name FROM ONLY cities to\u00a0exclude the\u00a0capitals. This is\u00a0something of\u00a0a\u00a0niche feature, but when you have the\u00a0right use case it\u00a0really shines. MySQL, being a\u00a0traditional RDBMS, doesn't do\u00a0this. Materialized views are like regular views, except the\u00a0results of\u00a0the\u00a0specifying query are physically stored ('materialized') and\u00a0must be\u00a0explicitly refreshed. This allows database developers to\u00a0cache the\u00a0results of\u00a0slower queries when the\u00a0results don't have to\u00a0be\u00a0realtime. Oracle has materialized views, and\u00a0SQL Server's indexed views are similar, but MySQL has no\u00a0materialized view support. Constraints in\u00a0general ensure that invalid data is\u00a0not stored. The\u00a0most common constraint is\u00a0NOT NULL, which prevents records without a\u00a0value for\u00a0the non-nullable column from being inserted or\u00a0updated. Foreign key constraints do\u00a0likewise when a\u00a0reference to\u00a0a\u00a0record in\u00a0another table is\u00a0invalid. Check constraints are the\u00a0most flexible, and\u00a0allow validation of\u00a0any predicate you could put in\u00a0a\u00a0WHERE clause -- for\u00a0example, asserting that prices have to\u00a0be\u00a0positive numbers, or\u00a0that US zip codes have to\u00a0be\u00a0five digits. Per the\u00a0MySQL docs: the\u00a0CHECK clause is\u00a0parsed but ignored by\u00a0all storage engines. Postgres and\u00a0MySQL both have a\u00a0JSON column type (MySQL replacement MariaDB does too, but it's currently just an\u00a0alias for\u00a0LONGTEXT) and\u00a0functions for\u00a0building, processing, and\u00a0querying JSON fields. Postgres actually goes a\u00a0step further by\u00a0offering a\u00a0JSONB type which processes input data into a\u00a0binary format. This means it's a\u00a0little bit slower to\u00a0write, but much faster to\u00a0query. It\u00a0also means you can index the\u00a0binary data. A\u00a0GIN or\u00a0Generalized INverted index allows queries checking for\u00a0the existence of\u00a0specific keys or\u00a0key-value pairs to\u00a0avoid scanning every single record for\u00a0matches. This is\u00a0huge if\u00a0you run queries which dig into JSON fields in\u00a0the\u00a0WHERE clause. DEFAULT is\u00a0a\u00a0useful specification for\u00a0columns in\u00a0a\u00a0CREATE TABLE statement. At\u00a0the\u00a0simplest level, this could be\u00a0used to\u00a0baseline a\u00a0boolean field to\u00a0true or\u00a0false if\u00a0the\u00a0INSERT statement doesn't give an\u00a0explicit value. But you can do\u00a0more than set a\u00a0scalar value: a\u00a0timestamp can default to\u00a0now(), a\u00a0UUID to\u00a0any of\u00a0a\u00a0variety of\u00a0UUID-generating functions, any other field to\u00a0the\u00a0value returned by\u00a0whatever function you care to\u00a0write -- the\u00a0sky's the\u00a0limit! Unless you're using MySQL, in\u00a0which case the\u00a0only function you can reference in\u00a0a\u00a0DEFAULT clause is\u00a0now(). Layout's only part of\u00a0the\u00a0story, though. Equally important is\u00a0the\u00a0difference in\u00a0type support. The\u00a0benefit of\u00a0a\u00a0robust type system is\u00a0in\u00a0enabling database architects to\u00a0represent information with the\u00a0greatest accuracy possible. If\u00a0a\u00a0value is\u00a0difficult or\u00a0impossible to\u00a0represent with built-in types, it's harder for\u00a0developers to\u00a0work with in\u00a0turn, and\u00a0if\u00a0compromises have to\u00a0be\u00a0made to\u00a0cut the\u00a0data to\u00a0fit then they can affect entire applications. Some types can even affect the\u00a0overall database design, such as\u00a0arrays and\u00a0enumerations. In\u00a0general, the\u00a0more options you have the\u00a0better. Postgres has a\u00a0UUID type. MySQL does not. If\u00a0you want to\u00a0store a\u00a0UUID in\u00a0MySQL, your options are CHAR, if\u00a0you want values to\u00a0be\u00a0as\u00a0human-readable as\u00a0UUIDs ever are, or\u00a0BINARY, if\u00a0you want it\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0faster but more difficult to\u00a0work with manually. Postgres also generates more types of\u00a0UUIDs. Boolean seems like a\u00a0pretty basic type to\u00a0have! However, MySQL's boolean is\u00a0actualy an\u00a0alias for\u00a0TINYINT(1). This is\u00a0why query results show 0 or\u00a01 instead of\u00a0true or\u00a0false. It's also why you can set the\u00a0value of\u00a0an\u00a0ostensibly boolean field to\u00a02. Try it! Postgres: has proper booleans. MySQL isn't alone in\u00a0aliasing standard types in\u00a0strange ways, however. CHAR, VARCHAR, and\u00a0TEXT types in\u00a0Postgres are all aliased representations of\u00a0the\u00a0same structure -- the\u00a0only distinction is\u00a0that length constraints will be\u00a0enforced if\u00a0specified. The\u00a0documentation notes that this is\u00a0actually slower, and\u00a0recommends that unbounded text simply be\u00a0defined as\u00a0the\u00a0TEXT type instead of\u00a0given an\u00a0arbitrary maximum length. What's happening here is\u00a0that Postgres uses a\u00a0data structure called a\u00a0varlena, or\u00a0VAriable LENgth Array, to\u00a0store the\u00a0information. A\u00a0varlena's first four bytes store the\u00a0length of\u00a0the\u00a0value, making it\u00a0easy for\u00a0the database to\u00a0pick the\u00a0whole thing out of\u00a0storage. TEXT is\u00a0only one of\u00a0the\u00a0types that uses this structure, but it's easily the\u00a0most commonly encountered. If\u00a0a\u00a0varlena is\u00a0longer than would fit inline, the\u00a0database uses a\u00a0system called TOAST (\"The\u00a0Oversized Attribute Storage Technique\") to\u00a0offload it\u00a0to\u00a0extended storage transparently. Queries with predicates involving a\u00a0TOASTable field might not be\u00a0all that performant with large tables unless designed and\u00a0indexed carefully, but when the\u00a0database is\u00a0returning records it's easy enough to\u00a0follow the\u00a0TOAST pointer that the\u00a0overhead is\u00a0barely noticeable for\u00a0most cases. The\u00a0upshot of\u00a0all this, as\u00a0far as\u00a0most people are concerned, is\u00a0this: with Postgres, you only have to\u00a0worry about establishing a\u00a0length constraint on\u00a0fields that have a\u00a0reason for\u00a0a\u00a0length constraint. If\u00a0there's no\u00a0clear requirement to\u00a0limit how much information can go\u00a0into a\u00a0field, you don't have to\u00a0pick an\u00a0arbitrary number and\u00a0try to\u00a0match it\u00a0up\u00a0with your page size. Non-scalar values in\u00a0records! Madness! Dogs and\u00a0cats living together! Anyone who's worked with JSON, XML, YAML, or\u00a0even HTML understands that information isn't always flat. Relational architectures have traditionally mandated breaking out any vectors, let alone even more complex values, into new tables. Sometimes that's useful, but often enough it\u00a0adds complexity to\u00a0no\u00a0real purpose. Inlining arrays makes many tasks -- such as\u00a0tagging records -- much easier. Postgres has arrays, as\u00a0does Oracle; MySQL and\u00a0SQL Server don't. If\u00a0the\u00a0built-in types aren't sufficient, you can always add your own. Custom types let you define a\u00a0value to\u00a0be\u00a0exactly what you want. Domains are a\u00a0related concept: types (custom or\u00a0built-in) which enforce constraints on\u00a0values. You might for\u00a0example create a\u00a0domain to\u00a0represent a\u00a0zip code as\u00a0a\u00a0TEXT value which uses regular expressions in\u00a0a\u00a0CHECK clause to\u00a0ensure that values consist of\u00a0five digits, optionally followed by\u00a0a\u00a0dash and\u00a0four more digits. If\u00a0you're using Postgres, that is. Oracle and\u00a0SQL Server both offer some custom type functionality, but MySQL has nothing. You can't even use table-level CHECK constraints because the\u00a0engine simply ignores them. Enumerations don't get enough love. If\u00a0I\u00a0had a\u00a0dollar for\u00a0every INT -- or\u00a0worse, VARCHAR -- field I've seen representing one of\u00a0a\u00a0fixed set of\u00a0potential values, I\u00a0probably still couldn't retire but I\u00a0could at\u00a0least have a\u00a0pretty nice evening out. There are drawbacks to\u00a0using enums, to\u00a0be\u00a0sure: adding new values requires DDL, and\u00a0you can't remove values at\u00a0all. But appropriate use cases for\u00a0them are still reasonably common. MySQL and\u00a0Postgres both offer enums. The\u00a0critical distinction is\u00a0that Postgres' enums are proper reusable types. MySQL's enums are more like the\u00a0otherwise-ignored CHECK constraints and\u00a0specify a\u00a0valid value list for\u00a0a\u00a0single column in\u00a0a\u00a0single table. Possible improvement on\u00a0allowing a\u00a0boolean column to\u00a0contain -100? So\u00a0that's data modeling covered. There's an\u00a0entire other half to\u00a0go: actually working with the\u00a0information being stored. SQL itself is\u00a0divided in\u00a0two parts, the\u00a0\"data definition language\" which defines the\u00a0structure of\u00a0a\u00a0database and\u00a0the \"data manipulation language\". This latter comprises the\u00a0SELECT, INSERT, and\u00a0other statements most people think of\u00a0when they hear the\u00a0name \"SQL\". And\u00a0just as\u00a0with modeling, there are substantial differences between Postgres and\u00a0MySQL in\u00a0querying. Autogenerating primary keys takes a\u00a0huge headache out of\u00a0storing data. But there's one catch: when you insert a\u00a0new record into a\u00a0table, you don't know what its primary key value got set to. Most relational databases will tell you what the\u00a0last autogenerated key was if\u00a0you call a\u00a0special function; some, like SQL Server, even let you filter down to\u00a0the\u00a0single table you're interested in. Postgres goes above and\u00a0beyond with the\u00a0RETURNING clause. Any write statement -- INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE -- can end with a\u00a0RETURNING [column-list], which acts as\u00a0a\u00a0SELECT on\u00a0the\u00a0affected records. RETURNING * gives you the\u00a0entire recordset from whatever you just did, or\u00a0you can restrict what you're interested in\u00a0to\u00a0certain columns. That means you can do\u00a0this: With MySQL, you're stuck with calling LAST_INSERT_ID() after you add a\u00a0new record. If\u00a0you added multiple, LAST_INSERT_ID only gives you the\u00a0earliest new id, leaving you to\u00a0work out the\u00a0rest yourself. And\u00a0of\u00a0course, this is\u00a0only good for\u00a0integer primary keys. MySQL also has no\u00a0counterpart to\u00a0this functionality for\u00a0UPDATEs\u00a0and\u00a0DELETEs. Competitor MariaDB supports RETURNING on\u00a0DELETE, but not on\u00a0any other kind of\u00a0statement. Common Table Expressions or\u00a0CTEs allow complex queries to\u00a0be\u00a0broken up\u00a0and\u00a0assembled from self-contained parts. You might write this: In\u00a0the\u00a0first query, we\u00a0aggregate visit counts; in\u00a0the\u00a0second, we\u00a0use DISTINCT ON on\u00a0the\u00a0results of\u00a0the\u00a0first to\u00a0filter out all but the\u00a0most popular pages; finally, we\u00a0join both of\u00a0our intermediary results to\u00a0provide the\u00a0output we're looking for. CTEs are a\u00a0really readable way to\u00a0factor query logic out, and\u00a0they let you do\u00a0some things in\u00a0one statement that you can't otherwise. MySQL does have CTEs! However: thanks to\u00a0the\u00a0RETURNING clause, Postgres can write records in\u00a0a\u00a0CTE and\u00a0operate on\u00a0the\u00a0results. This is\u00a0huge for\u00a0application logic. This next query writes a\u00a0record in\u00a0a\u00a0CTE, then adds a\u00a0corresponding entry to\u00a0a\u00a0junction table -- all in\u00a0the\u00a0same transaction. Sometimes a\u00a0query needs to\u00a0treat a\u00a0value as\u00a0if\u00a0it\u00a0has a\u00a0different type, whether to\u00a0store it\u00a0or\u00a0to\u00a0operate on\u00a0it\u00a0somehow. Postgres even lets you define additional conversions between types with CREATE CAST. MySQL supports casting values to\u00a0binary, char\/nchar, date\/datetime\/time, decimal, JSON, and\u00a0signed and\u00a0unsigned integers. Absent from this list: tinyints, which, since booleans are actually tinyints, means you're stuck with conditionals when you need to\u00a0coerce a\u00a0value to\u00a0true or\u00a0false for\u00a0storage in\u00a0a\u00a0\"boolean\" column. A\u00a0lateral join is\u00a0fundamentally similar to\u00a0a\u00a0correlated subquery, in\u00a0that it\u00a0executes for\u00a0each row of\u00a0the\u00a0current result set. However, a\u00a0correlated subquery is\u00a0limited to\u00a0returning a\u00a0single value for\u00a0a\u00a0SELECT list or\u00a0WHERE clause; subqueries in\u00a0the\u00a0FROM clause run in\u00a0isolation. A\u00a0lateral join can refer back to\u00a0information in\u00a0the\u00a0rest of\u00a0the\u00a0result set: It\u00a0can also invoke table functions like unnest which return multiple rows and\u00a0columns: Oracle and\u00a0SQL Server offer similar functionality with the\u00a0LATERAL keyword in\u00a0the\u00a0former, and\u00a0CROSS APPLY\/OUTER APPLY. MySQL does not. Functions! Procedures, if\u00a0you believe in\u00a0making that distinction! They're great! You can declare variadic arguments -- \"varargs\" or\u00a0\"rest parameters\" in\u00a0other languages -- to\u00a0pull an\u00a0arbitrary number of\u00a0arguments into a\u00a0single collection named for\u00a0the final argument. In\u00a0Postgres. A\u00a0handful of\u00a0useful operations which allow more expressive WHERE clauses with Postgres: That's it\u00a0for\u00a0the architecture and\u00a0query language feature gaps I\u00a0discovered. I\u00a0did run into a\u00a0couple other things that bear mentioning, however: MySQL doesn't care about dependencies among database objects. You can tell it\u00a0to\u00a0drop a\u00a0table a\u00a0view or\u00a0proc depends on\u00a0and\u00a0it\u00a0will go\u00a0right ahead and\u00a0drop it. You'll have no\u00a0idea something's gone wrong until the\u00a0next time you try to\u00a0invoke the\u00a0view or\u00a0proc. Postgres saves you from yourself, unless you're really sure and\u00a0drop your dependents too with CASCADE. Just the\u00a0mention of\u00a0triggers is\u00a0probably putting some people off their lunch. They're not that bad, honest (well, they can be, but it's not like it's their fault). Anyway, point is: sometimes you want to\u00a0write a\u00a0trigger that modifies other rows in\u00a0the\u00a0table it's being activated from. Well, you can't in\u00a0MySQL. This may have exhausted me, but I'm pretty sure it's still not an\u00a0exhaustive list of\u00a0the\u00a0feature gaps between Postgres and\u00a0MySQL. I\u00a0did cop to\u00a0my\u00a0preference up\u00a0front, but having spent six weeks putting the\u00a0effort into converting the\u00a0comparison is\u00a0pretty damning. I\u00a0think there could still be\u00a0reasons to\u00a0pick MySQL -- but I'm not sure they could be\u00a0technical.","time":1525710821,"title":"The ultimate postgres vs. mysql blog post","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/di.nmfay.com\/postgres-vs-mysql","label":3,"label_name":"dev"},{"by":"aarreedd","descendants":12,"id":17013153,"kids":"[17016831, 17030519, 17016537, 17020271]","score":31,"text":"Sleuth on your competition.

The service, advertised as a piece of JavaScript that webmasters embed on their sites, blocks EU-based users from accessing a website, just so the parent company won't have to deal with GDPR compliance. GDPR, or General Data Protection Regulation, is a new user and data privacy regulation slated to come into effect in the EU three weeks from now, on May 25, 2018. The new regulation brings a wealth of protections to user privacy but is a nightmare for companies doing business in Europe. The reasons are plenty, but the humongous fines for failing to meet GDPR standards are at the top of the list for most companies (\u20ac20 million\/$24 million or 4% of a company's annual worldwide revenue \u2014whichever is higher). There's also the 72-hour deadline to reveal data breaches and the necessity of hiring a so-called \"Data Protection Officer.\" Plus, GDPR also mandates that companies must inform users on what data they collected about them, allow them to review the data, and even let users delete the data from the company's servers if they so wish. Any company that has data on EU users is subject to the new GDPR regulation and can be fined, regardless if the company is not based in a EU state. As such, smaller companies that can't afford the exorbitant (consultation, legal, and technical) costs of becoming GDPR compliant, are hoping that nobody notices they're breaking the law or pulling out of the EU market altogether. Examples of companies and services that have withdrawn from the EU market because of GDPR include Verve (online marketing), Ragnarok Online (online game), Super Monday Night Combat (online game), Unroll (email subscription service), Brent Ozar Unlimited (software supplier), Tungle (gaming software provider), and Drawbridge (cross-device identity service) The list is probably bigger, as not all companies have made their decision public. Apart from this, there are also the companies that had no intent on breaking into the EU market but are serving customers regardless, and as such, are also falling under the GDPR umbrella. Here, a new trend has sparked \u2014blocking \"unwanted\" EU customers from accessing their sites in the first place. A company that has openly admitted to such a practice is Boston-based cyber-security firm Steel Root, which has implemented its own system that blocks EU-based users from accessing its service. But running such a system is not an option for companies with no experience in managing IP blacklists. Here's where the makers of GDPR Shield [archived link] have seen a business opportunity. \"Block EU users from accessing your site,\" the GDPR Shield website reads. \"Don't spend thousands on legal fees to make your site GDPR-compliant. If you aren't targeting EU users, simply use GDPR Shield to block all traffic from the EU,\" the company boasts. The GDPR Sheild service is not free, though, and sites that want to use it have to pay monthly fees from $9 upward. Similar services are bound to pop up on the web in the coming days, similar to how tens of websites appeared after the EU passed its infamous Cookie Law that mandated that each website ask users for permission before storing cookies on their devices. That useless EU regulation generated an influx of similarly useless popups all over the web, and the new GDPR regulation might have the unintended consequence of shutting out millions of EU users off of thousands or more websites owned by companies that are not in the mood of spending thousands of dollars to become GDPR compliant. DDoS Attacks Go Down 60% Across Europe Following WebStresser's Takedown Brexit: European Commission Wants to Cancel 317,000 .eu Domains Owned by Brits All fine and dandy as long as you have never had an EU Citizen on your site before or you start a new company now or delete everything out of your logs, databases, big data, IoT, third party feeds, otherwise your still at the mercy of GDPR. Just an FYI. And how will you handle EU Citizens logging on their computers from IP addresses that cannot be determined to be or not to be an EU location? Just curious. I think its a great idea for people going to websites but still has NO impact on those doing business with EU Citizens The question I have is whether or not blocking EU users will actually help spread awareness about how overreaching the law is, or if it will just cause a bunch of people to demand that the EU government \"force\" sites that are blocking EU users to stop doing so and comply with the law. If it's the former, then let the rest of the world IP block Europe until the law is repealed. It'll break the Internet for a little while, but I really can't think of a more effective protest. Well, great tools for all those wh want to collect, steal and abuse the users data. While GDPR requires some actions to be withdrawn, it is a pretty good solution if you want to use their data to have an impact on another US elections without risk of being caught on spying the EU Citizens.\n\nHaving such a tool few days ago, the Cambridge Analytica would not cease activities, just move their files to US. I follow Bleeing Computer because of the focus it have on threats to me and my data, partly in terms of ransomewarem partly in terms of other attacks or substandard intrusion protections. One would think this is a matter of the readers.\n\nYet to my dismay the reaction I see about the European GDPR is that it is bad and a problem when it actually prohibits things like Cambreige Analytica did together with Facebook and enables victims to be able to press charges and therefore should be welcomed. \n\nWhat GDPR does is to secure that I know where my information is, for what purpose it is collected, who else is allowed to know where it is and that the responsible organization keeps it safe. That's the essence. It also give me some rights; I can require an update of faulty information or that my information is deleted. This is not unreasonable demands on those that have a great insight in my private life. \n\nGDPR is for example the reason we now know that PayPall is sharing your information with 600+ companies, a well kept until recently. (ref Bruce Schneier). \n\nGDPR also makes it perfectly clear; while personal information shall be well protected it shall be exchangeable between actors and used to create value. This is from the first paragraph;\n\"The free movement of personal data within the Union shall be neither restricted nor prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data.\"\n\nI my self welcome GDPR and are looking forward to finally get some mandate to require other to keep my personal information safe. This is inline with what I talk about publicly. Of all the crap that comes out from EU, GDPR for one is a great regulation. The market of personal information has been to big to long. \n\nNaturally the change will cost money. Every company in the world with some economical size spend quite a lot of money on a finance department, auditors etc. That is both to secure that own financial assets but also to secure that it is managed within the lawful borders. The very same will now apply to other valuable assets - the information that is stored about customers. \n\nWhat need to be asked now is; do I need to collect this piece of information and for what purpose do I then collect it. \n\nIt is only reasonable to treat my personal information well and keep it safe from eavesdropping. \n\n\nI think it is much more troublesome that US companies need to share their information with US law enforcement regardless where it is located. I now need to find another provider than Google for my companies mail etc.  My company Steel Root is mentioned in this article as blocking EU-based visitors from our website. That is true, but we don't do it explicitly for GDPR as this article suggests.\n\nSee our blog, \"Is blocking European visitors to your website a valid GDPR strategy?\" for further thoughts on the subject: https:\/\/steelroot.us\/is-blocking-european-visitors-to-your-website-a-valid-gdpr-strategy\/\n\nThis article appears to have been sourced from Twitter, where a GDPR thread posted by @mikko went viral over the weekend. There's some good content on that thread - may I suggest this article cite its source? Uh these services are a scam. This treaty follows the CITIZEN not the physical location. \n\nI didn't understand this either until I meet with a lawyer who helped create the law in a conference. As a CISO healthcare company found out if an EU person walks into your US hospital you fall under GDPR once you take their data even though your hospital does not have a footprint in the EU. \n\nSo I would tell any company looking at a service like this, it will only limit both your risk and your business. IT WILL NOT PROTECT you from GDPR. \n\nAlso from the enforcement side the EU is looking at Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. They will be sued on day one and the fallout of those cases will determine how this will affect everyone else.  The scope is even wider than that. It concerns EU citizens alright, but it also concerns US (and other) citizens visiting EU during the stay. If Trump would visit EU information about him would temporary fall under GDPR. \n\nIn general it is a misunderstanding that GDPR is an IT concern. It is as much a Business concern. It is more about what the business decide to do with the information than encryption and intrusion detection. Naturally it is important to know what information is stored in the IT systems and to keep the risks low but that does not have anything to do with the purpose of storing the information in the first place. The purpose is one of the key elements in GDPR.  Not a member yet?

Lyme disease was once unheard of in western Pennsylvania, where Barbara Thorne, now an entomologist at the University of Maryland, spent time as a kid. Thorne knew that if black-legged ticks are infected with bacteria called Borrelia burgdorferi, they can transmit Lyme to people and, that if untreated, symptoms can range from fever, fatigue and a rash, to serious damage to the joints, heart and nervous system. But she didn't realize that ticks in that part of Pennsylvania had become broadly infected with the bacteria. That is, until she was bitten during a family reunion weekend. She never saw the tick on her body. But about eight or nine days later, after returning home, she became suspicious. \"I noticed a roundish red rash above my waistline and it expanded each day,\" she recalls. \"I was also feeling sick with exhaustion and achiness.\" Her primary care doctor diagnosed her with Lyme disease and prescribed a course of antibiotics. After a few months, she felt better. \"I felt very lucky to have had the rash appear as literally a red flag,\" Thorne says. It's a telltale warning sign of the disease. But not everyone with a Lyme infection develops a rash. And other symptoms, such as fatigue and aches, overlap with common illnesses. So, spotting Lyme disease can be tricky. Some people don't realize they're infected and don't seek medical treatment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the actual prevalence of Lyme disease infections is 10 times higher than the number of reported cases. Tick-borne diseases have been \"steadily going up every year ... as the diseases expand to new areas around the country,\" Lyle Peterson of the CDC told reporters in a recent conference call announcing the updated infection estimates. Lyme disease accounts for about 80 percent of the tick-borne illnesses in the U.S. Another factor that can contribute to the underreporting of cases is a lack of effective surveillance and tracking. \"People just go to their local doctor to be treated,\" says Peterson, and the doctor may not report the case to the local or state health department. Or, if the case is reported by the doctor, he says, sometimes \"state health departments have a very difficult time keeping up with the sheer number of cases reports.\" There's another factor at play, too: shortcomings in the way the infection is diagnosed. \"Many of the tests for Lyme disease are negative at the time that patients first visit their doctor,\" says Dr. Paul Fiedler, a clinical pathologist on Yale School of Medicine's faculty who also heads the department of pathology at Western Connecticut Health Network. Blood tests to detect Lyme disease rely on a person's immune response, Fiedler explains, and after infection with the bacteria, it takes time \u2014 sometimes as long as 10 to 30 days \u2014 for the body to mount a measurable response. The blood tests detect Lyme-specific antibodies. If somebody is tested before the immune system has produced enough antibodies, the result will be a false negative. \"And the diagnosis could be missed,\" Fiedler says. The subsequent lack of treatment after a missed diagnosis can lead to serious health problems. \n                Black-legged ticks are small \u2014 the nymphs can be as little as the head of a pin, making them tough to spot.\n                \n                \n                    \n                    Scott Camazine\/Science Source\/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Black-legged ticks are small \u2014 the nymphs can be as little as the head of a pin, making them tough to spot. But Thorne says it's possible to take steps to help prevent Lyme disease if you're meticulous. In the spring, tick nymphs \u2014 young versions that transmit most of the Lyme infections \u2014 are abundant. They're tiny, no bigger than a pinhead or poppy seed, and tend to hang out in or near wooded areas, in brush or tall grass. The ticks need a blood meal to stay alive. They tend to feed on small mammals, such as mice, or birds. But if you happen to brush against a stick, blade or stem they're clinging to, they can easily hitch a ride on you. And you won't feel a thing. If you're hiking in or near a wooded area, it's wise to be on the lookout for nymphs on your skin or clothing when you get home. \"They're small, but they're not invisible,\" Thorne says. She recommends light-colored clothing (to increase likelihood you'll notice the darker fleck of an insect) and long sleeves. Insect repellent may help, but Thorne says the most effective strategy is a thorough tick check of your body after you've been in tick-infested areas. \"The ticks do tend to climb upward \u2014 like they climb up your legs,\" Thorne says. \"They often attach where there was a constriction of clothing, like around the waistline.\" (She's compiled personal protection tips in this bulletin.) Other favorite hiding spots include armpits, or behind your ears. If you do find one attached to your body, use a pair of narrow tweezers to grasp the tick very near the surface of the skin and tug upward with steady pressure. Don't freak out if the arachnid's been attached a few hours. In general, the CDC says, ticks need to be attached for 36 to 48 hours before they can transmit the bacteria that cause Lyme disease.

(self.webdev) submitted 3 days ago * by FineHub I work for a major publisher. Ad-blockers are starting to hurt our revenue big time.  Our manager said that we should optimize by the order of average revenue per user. The browser with highest revenue per user should be optimized the most. Firefox is almost at the end of the list. I tried telling him that the people who use adblockers are likely to share more content, which brings in non-adblock users. However, that is also falling apart as adblock users are bringing other adblock users.  Chrome and Safari are our highest priority because of this. Firefox is like at the bottom of the list. I still have the chance, and I dont want to leave Firefox :(  What would be an argument that you think would be valid at this point? Obviously a business requires money to keep running. We tried putting anti-adblock notices, but an adblocker used by Firefox users mostly bypasses our measures. Ad reinsertion solutions exist for Chrome, but they also dont support Firefox.  We're doing a redesign now. Manager says that we should just discourage the users of Firefox (not optimizing for Firefox, and poor UI) from visiting our website as they bring a loss. Edit: \nThey are even going to approach google and ask them to introduce new  API's that allow us to determine if browser really chrome or just chromium, so that we block chromium. And a DRM for website instead of only video DRM that exists, so that user cannot view source code, and no extension can block the ads. Other publishers are doing the same thing. Expect new DRM for HTML5 too. Post a comment!  [\u2013]TheGidbinn 193 points194 points195 points 3 days ago\u00a0(6 children) If you're writing standards-compliant code based on current (not future) web standards then I don't see why you should have to go to great lengths to support any particular current web browser.  [\u2013]doyouevenliff 89 points90 points91 points 3 days ago\u00a0(1 child) sounds like they're trying to actively NOT support a web browser, lol    [\u2013]jwr 13 points14 points15 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) \u2026and then you try to insert an SVG and find out that you need all kinds of tweaks just so that it's the right size in all browsers. It's all good in theory, and I agree that we live in a golden age of compatibility, but in practice there are issues that come up, and it's not because you're trying to do overly fancy stuff.  [\u2013]ejo3 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago\u00a0(2 children) We follow web standards and optimize for Chrome first.  After that we find that making our sites work well on Safari and Firefox is relatively easy with Edge requiring a little more effort.  I agree with @TheGidbinn that it's usually not much more work to get FF working well.  All that said, you may have an existing codebase that makes this harder than I realize...  [\u2013]cptskippy 29 points30 points31 points 2 days ago\u00a0(1 child) I've been developing websites professionally since 1999 and I can say that we're actually in a golden age of cross browser compatibility.  It has never been easier to support every major browser platform without even consciously trying.  [\u2013]ejo3 2 points3 points4 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) I agree  [\u2013]Michael-Bell 134 points135 points136 points 3 days ago\u00a0(11 children) I'm going to be honest. If I encounter a site that optimizes for a specific browser rather than just make it work for any modern browser, I don't use the site.  I have no interest in reading click bait articles or doing online banking or whatever when the website tells me my modern, spec compliant browser isn't going to work. I've changed banks, started shopping at different stores and cancelled online subscriptions over this.  Personally I have no issue paying for a  online news source, provided the tracking js doesn't turn my laptop into a jet engine and any ads are not invasive. But at the end of the day you want your business model to discourage specific users, I don't care. I'll go somewhere else. Any articles I read will be on another platform. Anyone who sends me a link to your site will receive a lecture on your scummy web design and I'll try my hardest to get them on another site.   [\u2013]adamtaylor_13 23 points24 points25 points 3 days ago\u00a0(0 children) Yes, yes, yes, YES. A million times, YES. I made my own response to this thread which actually read very similar to your response. I refuse to support shitty business practices by greedy publishers. There is nothing unique that you're saying that I can't find somewhere else that will support my choice to use an ad-blocker.    [\u2013]wedragon 65 points66 points67 points 3 days ago*\u00a0(7 children) \/u\/FineHub , given the sheer amount of information competing everyday for  eyeballs, ask your boss if your company is in a position where you can choose your audience based on browser alone and, further, whether or not broken ux sends the sort of positive and stable message a major publishing operation wants to send to advertisers, potential users and content providers.   I get the sense that your boss may be looking at the data, gnashing his teeth and then producing some very strong, albeit false, dichotomies about end users that doesn't really jibe with reality or take into consideration the present nature of media consumption. \/u\/sjwking just gave you a great and familiar example of someone who uses adblockers on a primary, (desktop) environment but doesn't on mobile and said straight up that if he couldn't access the content on his main device there was no way he'd go and hunt for it on mobile later. His example was key in illustrating how much flow through there is between different mediums. As consumers we're more likely to have inconsistencies in our consumer habits  but we expect you to provide a consistent experience otherwise you lose us. It just doesn't work the other way around.  When you try to restrict the ux in one environment, you'll lose us in both.  And it isn't as though kneecapping one segment of your user base will only hurt those pesky Firefox kids. Your boss has really cut off his nose to spite his face. Crap design is one thing. Everybody is different with stuff like that. There are a few sites I hit that probably haven't changed since 1993 and I hope they never do. But the writing there is that good. Those sites are my dive bars  But a broken website? These days? That's a condemned building.  I see functional websites and deadsites but I hardly ever see broken sites. You have to tell your boss that this isn't hardball, it's job insecurity and it's bad for your CV.  I'm not unsympathetic to the issue at hand but your boss's shortsightedness is very hard to find sympathy with.

[\u2013]shavitush 126 points127 points128 points 3 days ago\u00a0(3 children) Only use approved standards and you'll have no compatibility issues. Supporting certain browsers is stupid.  [\u2013]Tyil 53 points54 points55 points 3 days ago\u00a0(1 child) It does sound like they've made a problem for themselves and are now stuck with shitty code. There's good standards that all major browsers support in similar fashion, so you never have to worry about this kind of thing. It's why we have standards in the first place. Targetting specific browsers and simply breaking on browsers that are not in your \"supported list\" is regressing back to the IE6 times. Remember the horror from those times? Because I do, and it's one of the reasons I simply refuse to do stupid shit at my work that'll only bite us in the ass later down the line.  [\u2013]shavitush 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago\u00a0(0 children) Yep, it sucks  [\u2013]wedragon 12 points13 points14 points 3 days ago\u00a0(0 children) You could go one step further and argue that at some point, it will be more labor intensive to ensure browser \"dysfunctionality\" than to simply keep things streamlined.  [\u2013]Jessie_James 79 points80 points81 points 3 days ago*\u00a0(8 children) The problem here is not the browsers, it's your ad delivery system.  Nearly every ad system relies on JavaScript to deliver content, or uses one of any number of advertisement systems with known names\/settings\/structures.  JavaScript and third-party scripts are trivial to block. If you want to serve ads on your website, you need to host the ads on your server, and use server-side logic to display the content on the website at the same time the page renders.  Allowing third party systems to load ads after the page has (technically) loaded is easy to block. Besides, it's not FF users, it's most users who hate popups, popunders, and any number of \"tricks\" which \"managers\" use to try and make money. Put ads on the pages, infrequently, and make your content flow easily around the ads and people won't complain, and won't block you. I've done this before on sites, and it's very effective.  [\u2013]Jeema3000 41 points42 points43 points 3 days ago\u00a0(3 children) But that would mean that publishers would have to put forth the effort to sell their own ad space and actually screen their own advertisers... \/s  [\u2013]HeimrArnadalr 13 points14 points15 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) No need for the sarcasm tag, that's exactly what it would mean.

The main issues with ads are performance and privacy, neither of which is a significant concern for advertisements a website is displaying first party.

[\u2013]josefjohann 9 points10 points11 points 2 days ago\u00a0(22 children) The main issues with ads are performance and privacy Huh? Since the dawn of advertising I've always thought the #1 issue with ads is undesired subconscious influence. You're okay with that part?  [\u2013]softawre 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago\u00a0(1 child) It's not subconscious if it's labeled an AD, like most sites do when they host their own ADs.  They're trying to be good to the user, be good to them too. Subconscious influence is what is happening these days on reddit, fb, and others that both try to make ADs look like regular content and have actual shilling going on.    [\u2013]Jonno_FTW 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) It's not like people see an ad and decide to buy a particular brand or vote for a particular candidate. What the advertiser actually wants is for you to be in a situation where a decision must be made and even though in the moment you don't recall the ad, you see their product and because it's familiar because you saw the ad and go for that one. For this reason advertisers take out ads in places like sports games of only to prevent their competitors from having the same exposure and for you to be exposed to their brand and products.     [\u2013]coolcosmos 2 points3 points4 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) Anyone could use their main domain as an ad proxy.

[\u2013]FineHub[S] 4 points5 points6 points 3 days ago\u00a0(30 children) Hi! Same here lol. But the problem is that manager says to optimize on the basis that browser for which the website is to be optimized most is where we make most money per user. Unfortunately Firefox has mostly advanced power users who block ads at a higher ratio. Our redesign is currently broken for Firefox, and he is saying to not fix it.  The way you are saying, you are just proving him right... :( He is saying to not care about FF website. So he does not care if you come to the site or not, he in fact does not want users like us (adblock users) to come to the website. I decided to ask the other people in the US team if they agree, and they said that not caring about Firefox is the most logical thing to do at this point. I'd imagine that most other websites will start following the same suit, which means even less share for Firefox :( Cant even leave the job, cause there are not much options.   [\u2013]maushu 30 points31 points32 points 3 days ago\u00a0(15 children) I'd imagine that most other websites will start following the same suit, which means even less share for Firefox :( You misunderstand. It's not less share for Firefox but less visits for the website (since it's \"broken\"). Why would Firefox users go to the website if they can go to the competition?  [\u2013]FineHub[S] 3 points4 points5 points 3 days ago\u00a0(13 children) Why would Firefox users go to the website if they can go to the competition?

[\u2013]FineHub[S] 3 points4 points5 points 3 days ago*\u00a0(10 children) We dont detect using useragent. Feature detection is used. The boss is actually a developer too.

[\u2013]m-p-3 6 points7 points8 points 3 days ago\u00a0(0 children) IMO it's a fight that is almost impossible to win. With more users becoming aware of adblockers and with devices like the Pi-Hole that does ad-filtering at the DNS\/network level where it doesn't matter which browser or devices you're using, ad-based revenues will become hard to sustain no matter what.  [\u2013]conniedoit 5 points6 points7 points 3 days ago\u00a0(7 children) anything can be faked client-side until DRM comes into play\nyou find another function to sniff the true client, and an extension is released to fool your script..( take canvas IDing for instance & the Canvas Blocker extension...)      [\u2013]Ad5001full-stack 6 points7 points8 points 3 days ago\u00a0(0 children) The competition is actually doing the same thing. That means the market's free and that the potential Firefox users will only go on your website, which is a revenue stream. Even though it doesn't bring money instantly, you still grow a bigger userbase which allows your website to get a bigger market share comparing to your competitors, and, theoricly more spreading by theses users which would result in more money.  Although that's pure theory and it may depend on the company, it's better to not have nasty stuff regarding compatibility or potential clients may not trust your company enough to support them enough to rely on it.    [\u2013]sarciszewski 15 points16 points17 points 2 days ago\u00a0(10 children) Maybe it's high time we launched an education effort to get more Chrome users to install uBlock Origin so they're on par with Firefox.

[\u2013]arkstfan 17 points18 points19 points 3 days ago\u00a0(1 child) Maybe inform the boss that ad blocker usage is going to continue to grow and instead of trying to optimize your horse carriage business start shifting to optimize the market that is growing.  Ad blockers won\u2019t block a line of text explaining that this article is sponsored by XYZ Corp with a url coded in. They won\u2019t block a paragraph extolling the new product from XYZ with a hard coded image and link. They don\u2019t do anything to stop the content creator from putting some or all content behind a pay wall.   [\u2013]boomfarmer 12 points13 points14 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) They won\u2019t block a paragraph extolling the new product from XYZ with a hard coded image and link Some adblockers will block the image if it's loaded from a known-bad URL such as example.org\/ads-bucket\/...., as opposed to if it were  loaded from the same URL as non-ad images at example.org\/wp-content\/2018\/05\/....  [\u2013]bjwest 15 points16 points17 points 3 days ago\u00a0(3 children) Quick two questions.   Do you screen your advertisers,  or do you use an advertising service?  If I turn off add\/script blocking,  will you take full responsibility for any damages to my system or pay me for my time I need to clean any malware off it?  [\u2013]FineHub[S] 5 points6 points7 points 3 days ago*\u00a0(2 children) We dont take full responsibility. But we do screen the ad networks and allow only the most strict ones. Screening completely all ads is impossible, risk will always remain. But we try out best, and have an active team of 3 people who's job is to manually block malicious ads from appearing on our website.  [\u2013]webifox 17 points18 points19 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) You're asking me, the reader, to assume responsibility for any mess you, the publisher, are making on my system. Here's your problem.  Newspapers are fundamentally advertising companies, and you're outsourcing your profit center.  (Years ago, Google realized that search engines were the same, and so they wisely decided to invest in advertising innovation.)  I don't know any company in the world who has successfully outsourced their profit center for any length of time.  That's where companies go to die.  You're Eastman Kodak.  Dead man walking. I don't know why you claim it's impossible to screen ads for malice.  Google does it at a scale a million times bigger than you.  Here's how: the advertiser types their advertising copy in a text box, and you escape it properly and add it to your HTML.  Boom, done.  That problem has been solved since the early 1990's. Advertising is only a problem for you because you seem stuck on (a) outsourcing the entire process, and (b) allowing annoying JS\/CSS\/image-based ads.  Neither is fundamental to advertising.  Both, however, are fundamental to malware distribution.  Is it any wonder users hate your ads? Medium is critical.  If you distributed your news stories on PornHub, you wouldn't be surprised if people mistook them for porn.  You're using a malware distribution system for your ads, and getting upset that people are trying to block it. Take responsibility for what's on your website, and your readers won't bend over backwards to block half of it.  [\u2013]tragicpapercut 3 points4 points5 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) Without that full responsibility you will continue to see increased adblock usage. The fact that you need a team of 3 people means that someone from your customer base is getting malicious ads on your website and that your website is generally aware.  I'm any other industry this would be called a security breach and your site would be liable for damages. The fact that this is normal business for the ad publishers means the model is broken.  Publishers either don't know or don't care about their users... And yet users are supposed to just let this happen.  [\u2013]WildPhilosophy 16 points17 points18 points 3 days ago\u00a0(1 child) Your manager doesn't want a website, they want an app. Tell them to build an app and require their readers to use an app. \u00af_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af  [\u2013]LimbRetrieval-Bot 7 points8 points9 points 3 days ago\u00a0(0 children) You dropped this \\   To prevent anymore lost limbs throughout Reddit, correctly escape the arms and shoulders by typing the shrug as \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af or \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_\/\u00af Click here to see why this is necessary  [\u2013]batisteo 68 points69 points70 points 3 days ago\u00a0(9 children) Your business model is wrong.

[\u2013]pm_me_your_pantry 12 points13 points14 points 2 days ago\u00a0(2 children) I imagine OP is interested in keeping his job for longer than his boss manages to see into the future.  [\u2013]Jugg3rnaut 2 points3 points4 points 2 days ago\u00a0(1 child) Agreed. The correct response to OP's question is that moral stances can only go so far, and that OP can tell his boss to support the open web and all, but if for a certain subgroup of users revenue < cost (even including the additional business they bring in), then from a business POV it doesn't make sense to support them. The open web doesn't magically put food on the business owner's plate. Unfortunately this is the publisher vs. adblock conflict taken to the extreme.    [\u2013]cadadr_ 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) I guess they can refuse to work at an unethical company, and given they are a programmer, they'd hardly experience unemployment.  I think that \/u\/FineHub can best support FF and sanity by just quitting.  [\u2013]GourdGuard 5 points6 points7 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) Not really. People aren't ad blocking because it's fun. The use of an ad blocker is a response to bad behavior on the part of publishers and advertisers. Rather than escalate they should be looking for ways to fix themselves.   [\u2013]webifox 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) Not necessarily.  The question is how to logically support not breaking this webpage for Firefox users, but OP's managers have already demonstrated that they (a) don't understand how the web works, and (b) aren't amenable to logical technical arguments.  This is a perfect example of an XY problem.  [\u2013]timf3d 16 points17 points18 points 3 days ago\u00a0(1 child) I think it's fine. As a Firefox user, I can tell you that the kind of people who use Firefox are also the kind of people to not give a shit about what's on your web site because we will actively stay away from it anyway. Your manager is absolutely right. You should be targeting the least-knowledgeable people of the Internet who are completely oblivious to security, their rights, and how things actually work in the world. You should tell your manager to go ahead full speed and proceed with all haste to flush your investors' money down the toilet as quickly as you can.

[\u2013]Anonymous_Mentat 15 points16 points17 points 3 days ago\u00a0(0 children) You stop supporting Firefox, I stop using your website, it's that simple.

[\u2013]sjwking 11 points12 points13 points 3 days ago\u00a0(39 children) There are few differences between ff and chrome. Bootstrap and most js libraries take care of them. But by trial and error you will learn to write better cross compatible code. From my rather limited experience, most problems arrise when we take some shortcuts and chrome penalizes us less than ff for being lazy.  [\u2013]FineHub[S] 6 points7 points8 points 3 days ago*\u00a0(38 children) Our redesign is currently broken for Firefox, and he is saying to not fix it.  The situation is not that I don't want to fix. He does not want us to fix. His logic is that, Firefox users are a net negative profit for the website, since past 1 year. He wants to discourage FF users from visiting our website, so that atleast FF don't make a loss from them.  We tried experimenting with letting users pay for ad-free experience. Less than 1% of adblock users decided to pay. After monitoring since past 1.5 years, he said literally \"** Firefox!\".  Next he says that browser which mimic chrome user agent, but are actually chromium, we should block them too. This means no linux users on the site too :( We are killing 20% of our traffic cause of this.  Only browsers to allow are Chrome, Safari, Opera, Vivaldi, IE, Edge. We suspect that other browsers will spoof their useragent, but feature detection will still let us block them.  [\u2013]sjwking 26 points27 points28 points 3 days ago\u00a0(24 children) This is bullshit logic. I have adblock on desktop but I don't bother using adblock on my phone. If your website doesn't work for me on the desktop then fuck it, I will have a very bad opinion of your company and not use it on mobile. Also politely asking for disabling adblock will make a significant number of users to disable it.  [\u2013]FineHub[S] 6 points7 points8 points 3 days ago*\u00a0(23 children) Heck the website works even on IE 8+ but we don't want to properly on FF! Also politely asking for disabling adblock will make a significant number of users to disable it. We did! Since past 2 years we have been doing this. Not even 5% disabled. When we had put hard ban, 20% disabled. The rest were using a specific adblocker that bypasses adblock detection (mostly on FF). I will have a very bad opinion of your company and not use it on mobile. Tell that to him. His reply to this statement \"Great! We dont care! You dont make money for us, we dont care about your opinion.\" This was not his attitude, but has happened in past few months as we saw steep (30-40%) decline in revenue.  [\u2013]s3rila 5 points6 points7 points 3 days ago\u00a0(19 children) Isn't he right in the end ? your website need to be viable and make money and firefox end's up being at the end of the list of priority. I think I agree with his reasoning even if i'm someone which will never disable addblock.  the solution might be to make money without ads, i don't know your company but I guess that's not doable.  [\u2013]UnnamedPredacon 7 points8 points9 points 3 days ago\u00a0(6 children) There are always alternatives. For example, your company could sell and run its own ads. Not only it's more difficult to block, you get a higher share of the ad money.   [\u2013]FineHub[S] 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago\u00a0(5 children) Non targeted ads dont even make 15% of targeted ads.

[\u2013]UnnamedPredacon 16 points17 points18 points 3 days ago\u00a0(0 children) That's precisely what newspapers have been doing  for a century now.  The crux of the problem is that advertisers want to know everything about the user, and have resorted to extremely underhanded tactics to do so. The users have had enough, and are now retaliating. That should surprise no one.  If you need an example to better advertising, look what podcasts have been doing. They lack all the bells and whistles that advertisers want, yet it hasn't stopped them from earning a living.   [\u2013]wedragon 7 points8 points9 points 3 days ago\u00a0(0 children) \/u\/UnnamedPredacon, just called it. I'll bet you a very large percentage of those who use adblockers do so not out of contempt for ads in and of themselves. It isn't the ads I object to so much as all of the other crap being culled about each and every person when they are online. It's the assumption that any and every \"business\" entity hustling online today has the right to hoover up every last bit of commoditizable information about you, me and anybody else.  I, for instance, am still into print. I subscribe to a dozen magazines and newspapers. These aren't necessarily cheapo multi-year subscriptions either. Some cost a pretty penny and the content is that proprietary. Plus, I actually do this with the intention of supporting the publisher. If I found out that any one of these entities was pulling the stunts your paper is, I might actually cancel the subscription and then write a piece about 'worst practices' in publishing, cite the entity, talk to other writers on staff and jump and blow out the piece on a discussion of the need for sort of 'better standards in advertising', submit to one of the mags and have it published.  People will continue to go to great lengths to protect themselves online and I guarantee you that those going to those lengths are probably more often than not a demographic that actually still reads because we haven't even talked about the percentage of people who just don't read. That's ultimately a bigger threat to your industry than people who do their due diligence because no serious gold standard model of digital advertising has been introduced yet, at least as far as I know.  [\u2013]GourdGuard 2 points3 points4 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) If you can't run your business in a way that you are proud of, maybe it's not a viable business.

I can't think of a quicker way to kill a business.  [\u2013]FineHub[S] 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago*\u00a0(10 children) the solution might be to make money without ads, i don't know your company but I guess that's not doable. We tried asking for money ($3 a month: our average revenue per user per month). Less than 3% even clicked. 0.5% paid. There is no alternate to ads. They don't want to view ads, but they also don't want to pay. We get repeat visitors around 20 times a month on average. No clickbait either. IDK why people wont disable adblock. We dont even serve intrusive ads. Simple doubleclick ads. No shady network. No autoplay. No get rich quick, or that type of ads either. Blanked banning is also hurting the reputation of FF in front of publishers. Its sad that once at front of open web, is becoming irrelevant.   [\u2013]Alan976 14 points15 points16 points 3 days ago*\u00a0(0 children) I think if people that  disabled whatever adblocker they use, and if they find you site 100% safe, they might become regulars.

[\u2013]naavis 10 points11 points12 points 3 days ago\u00a0(4 children) This begs the question: if people are not willing to pay for the content you serve, is the content good enough?  [\u2013]adamtaylor_13 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago\u00a0(3 children) Eh, I don't think that's the question that will solve the problem though. If I'm paying for content, it must be of a tier that I will pay hundreds of dollars per-month for it. It must be that good. If you're asking for a measly $10\/month? I'm not paying for whatever you might scrape up for $10\/month. Seriously, it's counter-intuitive but I'm not paying for cheap-ass content I can find anywhere. If I'm paying you for content it's probably a course-based education content along the lines of hundreds per month. Of course, I'm just one person. But I think the question itself is flawed.

And of course, because of my adblocker, I'll never know. As others suggested, if you really really believe your ads are benign, serve them yourself. Honestly, the third-party-ad model is broken. If you can't change it, by all means keep breaking the web - more people will switch to sites with better commercial practices. It's a vicious circle: the more people you explicitly kick out, the more potential audience \"good\" competitors get, the less your site is relevant, the less money it makes, the more people you kick out... Oh, and DRM for whole pages won't happen because it would open a can of worms: browsers would become legally responsible for enforcing copyright across the whole web. They accepted it with media because codecs and so on were already developed elsewhere, the browser could just be a relatively dumb pipe; with HTML, they would have to do it all themselves, and that's not going to fly.

Sure, maybe you don't optimize for Firefox, but actively harming their experience is, frankly, foolish. 2) Treating people differently based on their revenue may make business sense, but it is a dick move. If you walk into a restaurant and are left standing while nicer dressed people get tables, what do you think of that restaurant? Same thing here.  3) If Firefox traffic lit erally costs you money, that is a reason to optimize them - profits are cos ts minus revenue per users, so maybe if you optimized Firefox performance,  your costs would drop and they would bring you better profit anyway.

Firstly, market share is still high enough that you're giving a lot of people a  possibly really bad experience if you don't. Secondly, if you get into the habit then you're more likely to create apps that don't use quirks, side effects or transient features, and will be more stable in the long run in all browsers.

[\u2013]Callahadmozilla devrel 8 points9 points10 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) The Web works because no single vendor has absolute control over the platform, and the competing browsers can keep each other in check.

[\u2013]henry_flower 7 points8 points9 points 2 days ago\u00a0(1 child) There is an old book titled 'In search of stupidity' about management idiocies of several (big in the past but now long dead) companies. I think your employer would have been a perfect candidate for such a book. Instead of focusing on making existing customers happy, on acquiring new happy customers, he cares about some irrelevant staff like 2% of users who still use ff; as every lunatic, he justifies his behaviour w\/ \"THEY BRING A LOSS, CRUSH THEM!\" cries. a pathetic childish behaviour.

[\u2013]MIK517 13 points14 points15 points 3 days ago\u00a0(41 children) I do not understand what you mean by \"they bring a loss\". Increased load on server? You pay to your host for each visit? Even if the only purpose of your website is to display ads to visitors, intentionally driving them away if they do not watch it is pretty stupid. Wasting resources to develop intentionally bad UI to drive them away is even more stupid, especially so if you try to justify it by wanting to cut ineffective spendings. If your business indeed not interested in firefox users then just dont test your site for firefox. Nowdays browsers mostly comply with standards, so most likely it will still work the same way as Chrome and Safari anyway (unles you use some vendor specific features).  [\u2013]FineHub[S] 4 points5 points6 points 3 days ago\u00a0(40 children) I do not understand what you mean by \"they bring a loss\". Increased load on server? You pay to your host for each visit? Yup. The revenue Firefox user makes for us is not enough for us to justify the costs incurred due to bandwidth and (heavy) use of computational resources (his logic).  We're not loading the CSS on Firefox as per his instructions. The JS detect using feature detection if browser is Firefox, and if true, it does not load CSS.

We don't give a flying fuck about CSS because the Reader Mode removes all of it anyway. And if there's really an anti-Firefox JavaScript code on a very busy website, it won't take long before a TamperMonkey script is made to un-do all your work.

How much does the company stand to save by implementing this (forgetting the $3 per user projected revenue for a second, since that is gone either way)? How does it compare to how much the company will lose because those users are not sharing your articles on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc? You said before that adblockers account for 20% of your traffic, so it stands to reason that they also account for 20% of your social media referrals. How much do you lose if 20% of your social media referrals disappear?  If you want to change your boss's mind, you need to speak his language.

Instead of enabling all 3rd-party content, I simply disabled 1st-party JS and the site suddenly resumed working normally. So you're actually making people show less.   Can't you self-host banner and link ads as an alternative? That's still more revenue than displaying nothing. Most adblockers will only block 3rd-party content. They don't magically discover what's an ad and what's not, they have a blacklist of spammy and tracking domains.  [\u2013]cyberjellyfish 4 points5 points6 points 3 days ago*\u00a0(4 children) If you're doing heavy computation and using a ton of bandwidth to serve newspaper articles, something's gone wrong.

I remember attending a discussion on this looming crisis ~5 years ago with a number of influential actors (including the editor-in-chief of one of the most influential magazines in Europe): ad revenue has been going down steadily for a number of years and it's not going to improve. This is true on all platforms, all browsers, even without ad-blockers, and your boss is fighting a losing battle. If your company needs to survive, it needs a backup plan. Just because Firefox is better at ad-blocking than other browsers doesn't mean that the others are not going there. I'm thinking in particular of iOS-based users. Does your company intend to ban them after banning Firefox users? If so, who's next? Whatever short-term path you pick, I suspect that antagonizing your users is a bad investment in the long run. As a side-note, the general user-hostility of ads is why people are using more and more adblockers. Also, betting the barn on Google sounds risky at best. As another side-note, this exact problem is one of the reasons for which browser vendors have started working on web micropayments. Not sure of the current status of this effort, though.  [\u2013]prite 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago\u00a0(2 children) I'm thinking in particular of iOS-based users. Does your company intend to ban them after banning Firefox users?  Yup, looks like that's what they want to do: \"They are even going to approach google and ask them to introduce new API's that allow us to determine if browser really chrome or just chromium, so that we block chromium.\"  [\u2013]ImYoric 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago\u00a0(1 child) Does anybody think that going out of your way to get rid of users is a good idea?

[\u2013]wedragon 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago\u00a0(0 children) Nice. A lot of people tried to help this guy, myself included, but this whole thing is fishy and the facts have been slippery throughout. He presented as working for a major publisher. Based on all of the information he kept throwing back out there and the frequent use of the past tense, he sure did make it sound like this was a seasoned outfit that's been out there and online for awhile. He even went on to say it was a newspaper.That was what he worked for. A newspaper. But then when \/u\/gorhill4 observed that he wasn't aware of , \"any report of a \"major publisher\" site being afflicted by CSS failing to load on Firefox. Surely this would have been already reported\/investigated by now?\".  OP responded, \"Note really Raymond. We have not yet put it in production.\". Go figure. Meanwhile, it was established, somewhere along the way, that not only would the major publisher stop supporting Firefox, OP was instructed by management to ensure Firefox didn't load at all. Oh, and he subsequently said they were ceasing support for Linux because Chromium would also stop getting support. Linux, of course, is saut\u00e9ed in browser options and I'm not talking about Konqueror either (but, hell, why not). And now, he's trying to bring down the Brave browser by telling on them. It's kind of like making a citizen's arrest in the codified world of 'codifiers'!. Hey, well, I didn't even realize I was on this sub until sometime yesterday. The guy posted the same question on \/r\/Firefox and I must have clicked something that dropped me off over here. Thanks for good times, everybody. The world is a curious, curious place.  [\u2013]conniedoit 5 points6 points7 points 3 days ago*\u00a0(2 children) the DRM response to ad blocking has been brewing for a long time I guess, and will probably end up being proposed by... drum roll... google. my personal policy is to just stop going to sites who block me for using adblock btw\nI guess publishers should think twice before blocking smart users ;-) i didn't even know chrome did ad \"reinsertion\" ??? how are they pulling that off exactly ?\nI never use chrome so I didn't even know it was possible !  [\u2013]FineHub[S] 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago\u00a0(1 child) i didn't even know chrome did ad \"reinsertion\" ??? how are they pulling that off exactly ? I never use chrome so I didn't even know it was possible ! Chrome does not do it. What I mean is if you use ADP or Adblock, they have acceptable ads program. FF users mostly use uBO on our website, so it does not have it. Chrome does not allow reinsertion. The adblock extensions do.     [\u2013]OptionX 4 points5 points6 points 3 days ago\u00a0(0 children) So what your saying is Firefox adblocking works!  [\u2013]THIS_BOT 4 points5 points6 points 3 days ago\u00a0(0 children) A lot of your situation is making less and less sense to me. You said that FF users don\u2019t get JS or CSS or content, but they get the html? You\u2019re loading js at some point in order to feature-detect. HTML doesn\u2019t have conditionals and it\u2019s a good amount of effort to exclude specific css and js based on browser while keeping the code maintainable. And to go this far to save ad money when taking a much smaller effort to efficiently serve from a CDN would likely be more cost effective. What major publishers disable reader mode? Which ones do any of this? Frankly if you\u2019re losing money on page views, don\u2019t have reader mode, and actually have code so broken that it\u2019s this much of an effort to maintain support for FF, then you have serious organizational and business issues and what to do with FF users should be the least of your concerns.  [\u2013]MistYeller 5 points6 points7 points 3 days ago\u00a0(0 children) I would say that completely breaking your site for firefox users likely stops any story you have from ever going viral. If users of that browser reach what is an even bigger deal breaker than a hard paywall, you may not get posted to reddit for instance, at least you may find that your articles get downvoted, so you reach even fewer of your monetized users. Then, what is a \"major\" publisher but one with a good reputation? This will just tank your reputation with those users. As your \"highly\" monetized users stop hearing about you so much, they will start to think you aren't as important as you used to be. The fact that you are going out of your way to break the experience and not just being negligent about supporting it will make the situation even worse if people know about it. I would say those are two pretty big negative feedbacks right there.  [\u2013]mikkelhoegh 4 points5 points6 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) For desktop browsers, Firefox has a 12% market share world wide (mobile is harder to tell, due to the way 3rd party browsers work on iOS): http:\/\/gs.statcounter.com\/browser-market-share\/desktop\/worldwide The business case is simple enough. Is 12% (or whatever the market share is in your locale) of desktop users worth supporting? Not every FF user has adblock, but many do, so lets guesstimate that blocking Firefox would cost 5% of your revenues. If you\u2019re a major publisher, 5% of your revenue is a lot of money. I would say the business case for supporting FF is obvious. And as for your managers\u2019 dreams about more DRM in browsers, they should probably not get their hopes up too much. Browser makers are almost certainly going to tell them to get fucked.  [\u2013]webifox 5 points6 points7 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) You work for a publisher that's going out of business, doesn't know how to make standards-compliant webpages, doesn't understand how to maximize profit, and doesn't understand how the web works. I was going to say this \"major publisher\" is simply clueless on all levels and we'll all be happy when they go out of business, but that final paragraph (\"Edit\") makes me think this is just a troll.  Nobody can be that clueless, can they?  [\u2013]grg2014 4 points5 points6 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) If you are a publisher and want me to add to your revenue stream, make sure I don't have to jump through hoops to do so.

[\u2013]Anonymous_number_00 6 points7 points8 points 3 days ago\u00a0(1 child) No I don't really care about your revenue, I will use Ad blockers because I can, like your publishing company you work for needs more money the people of the net don't care.If you want to make the site sht for adblock users, then they will use someone else simple.   [\u2013]GourdGuard 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) I think you are getting to the core of the problem for publishers. There's a glut of content out there. If tomorrow Reddit started blocking me because I use an ad blocker, I would be okay with that and just go somewhere else. I don't pay anything for Reddit and frankly that's about what it's worth to me.  I do pay for subscriptions to places I find myself at often. I think semi-porous paywalls are the way to go.

Forbes has never, and will never get my business. Nor will Washington Post, etc. It's simply a respect to users.

[\u2013]Alskttiio 4 points5 points6 points 3 days ago\u00a0(0 children) What happens in the future when Chrome's marketshare shrinks and Firefox or something else starts to eat it up? What happens when Chrome users start to use uBlock more, or Chrome introduces a built-in ad-blocker like Safari did? Supporting multiple browsers is not only being a good web citizen, it is also a defensive strategy for when things change in the future.  How many successful websites do you know that only support one web browser? None. Last time that was a thing, it was IE-only. Now nobody uses IE unless they are forced to do so at work. Think about how expensive it must have been to rewrite IE-only software for other browsers, or to find talented developers who want to only develop for IE?  It sounds easy to just say \"don't support X browser. We'll save time and money\". You're just pigeonholing your company, and it will be expensive to dig yourselves out of a situation like that when you need to adapt (when, not if). https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/1\/4\/16805216\/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards  [\u2013]snarfy 3 points4 points5 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) That's OK I don't want to see what your publisher is peddling anyway.  [\u2013]rat9988 3 points4 points5 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) I have a different opinion from the rest of the thread. If firefox users are a loss of money, just drop support for it. Sucks to say it, I ALWAYS use adblock, but if I was a company owner, I'd see adblock user as bandwith thief.  People are free to use adblocking services, content publishers are free to choose their audience. I believe freedom goes both way. And an audience that makes me lose money is surely an audience I won't support as a publisher.  [\u2013]wedragon 3 points4 points5 points 2 days ago*\u00a0(0 children) For the sleuths among us, http:\/\/www.refdesk.com\/paper.html.  I just did a quick visit & click about on the 60+ U.S. \"national\" papers with local, national and often international audiences, every single one was perfect on my FF browser w\/ blocking enabled. There are a few that are subscription based but they functioned fine. Of the 20+ major international papers listed in Refdesk, only one paper -the Times of India -proved to be buggy on Firefox: photos ddidn't always load and there were a lot of links with jitter.  My reaction? They have some serious work to do. As a potential reader, I wouldn't bother with reading the content on offer and I'd end up with a low opinion of the paper as a result. What I wouldn't do is pull the site up in another browser. The information isn't proprietary enough and I absolutely would not think this was a move against Firefox and its users. It just looks like dodgy work and that reflects poorly on the paper itself.  I didn't do this just to be a pedant nor because I'm now curious what paper you represent.  That Refdesk list is a pretty good indicator of currently accepted online publishing standards and that's the point I think you should make with your boss. Show him by example. Whatever region you guys are operating out of it may well be the case that you and another paper are competing with similar anti-compatibility tactics towards particular browsers but that just isn't the case with the wide gamut of online papers today. I really encourage you to show him a bigger picture here. I hope that helps.  [\u2013]mattstreet 2 points3 points4 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) This kinda reads like an ad for FireFox to me.  [\u2013]jay76 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago*\u00a0(4 children) There are ways to prove your assertion about FF users bringing in other traffic (see something like Google Analytics with its referrers metric and\/or utm tracking). I'd be surprised if a major publisher doesn't have some of this information already, but you might need to implement more comprehensive tracking to get a detailed picture. It sounds like you might have to hit your manager with some hard numbers to make a strong enough case. Also, I'm interested to hear about the cases where you've had to build specifically for Firefox? It sounds like you might be doing non standard stuff, which is akin to purposefully asking for compatibility problems (I may be wrong).  [\u2013]FineHub[S] 1 point2 points3 points 3 days ago\u00a0(3 children) Adblockers even block google analytics :(  [\u2013]jay76 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago\u00a0(2 children) If you are tracking utms for referrals, then the tracking will work, since it's the second person who will fire off the beacon. eg:  It's only going to give you a partial image, but it might be enough to convince.  [\u2013]NatoBoram 2 points3 points4 points 3 days ago\u00a0(1 child) Considering more tech savvy people use more Firefox and AdBlock more\u2026 I can't speak for the rest of the world but be aware that I clean my URLs when I share a link.

In exchange, the ad-specific markup has a limit on what it can do (i.e., can only serve static images\/videos with links and tracking beacons and has a universal close button and report button and cannot execute  javascript which make the browsers slow and can contain bitcoin miners).

The reason most of us prefer internet over other sources of information is because we don't like ads. Like, I want to watch a movie, not  watch a movie AND 20 minutes of ads distributed through it. I want to read see an article, not 50% article and 50% of whatever gimmick distributor paid for advertisement. And I don't know about you, but I hate ads in general. If I want to buy something I'll do my own market research. If I want to learn about something, I'll ask my friends and their acquaintances, as well as related communities. All important news I get from the very sources of those news, be it media persons, companies, etc. And, what's the worst - not just ads are plain annoying, they are also a pain in terms of blocking content or sometimes straight up make the page unusable do to multiple resizings. That is especially painful on mobile devices that have no such thing as web browser extension.  [\u2013]binarycleric 2 points3 points4 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) This is a really shitty thing to say but at the end of the day, you are working for a business who often has to make decisions based on revenue. If you want to remain employed you have to do what they ask (assuming it is legal), but you should make your disapproval known. Sadly, years of unacceptable and intrusive ads have made ad-blockers a necessity. When you are pushing trash javascript onto a user's browser, it is absolutely within their rights to say \"no\" and not execute your code. Trying to get around ad-blockers is an arms race. For every clever developer who thinks they have found a bypass, there are 10 developers who have written code to plug the hole. This isn't really a question you can answer, unfortunately. You have to do what your bosses ask you if you want to keep your job but the business needs to evolve beyond relying on ad revenue. Personally, all modern browsers should always be supported but we rarely have time to make sure that is the case. Even companies like Google and Amazon struggle with this on some products. My employer is rather large (25k+ employees, many are technical in nature) and offers nearly 100% web-based applications to a wide variety of businesses. We struggle with this hard. When IE 6\/7 were the bane of the internet, I often followed the \"minimally functional\" mindset and make sure that my sites at least worked in a read-only sense on those browsers. Outright blocking or placing landmines for Firefox will either make users abandon your site entirely or come up with new ways to get around this without changing browsers. Almost nobody opens up a different browser to read a certain site anymore, they'll either go to news aggregators or elsewhere for their content. Good luck. This is a shitty position to be in but my professional advice would be to not take these kinds of business decisions personally. We can only do our best and hope that is good enough.

[\u2013]ERR_noUsername 2 points3 points4 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) Sounds like the publisher deserves to go out of business. Good riddance.  I feel sorry for people that 1) will lose their jobs and 2) have to work in such a place for the time being, as I know it's not trivial to move jobs and much of your publisher's views are very widespread in the industry. But I will not shed a tear for any company or site that shutters because of dried up ad-revenue or intentionally breaking their own site as a vendetta against certain browsers. It's just useless clawing at the sky at this point. Your ads will be blocked by an increasing number of users using an increasing number of methods. Companies that don't move on from this reality have dug their own grave and have no one else to blame. They built their business on a shaky foundation and now it's crumbling. At some point the users of Chrome will find their way through. In Chrome, I can use a combo of tools to get around anti-adblock. Hell, some of us run Pi-hole and block ads at network level. What then? DRM sounds like a solution, but I believe it will just result in a fraction of the users that you're even seeing now. Any company that chases ad-revenue via DRM is chasing it to their grave. I wish you could tell us which publisher this is so I can actively avoid ever touching any site affiliated with them.

Information should be freely available irrespective of ad-blocking. I'd be more likely to support publishers by disabling my ad-blocker if they asked me to disable it (as many websites do now).  I feel like this would be counter-intuitive as well, instead of getting hits on your website, you would see your web content drop exponentially on all browsers, not just Firefox.

Isn't that worse than having people on the website ? Maybe this business model is not the good one...   [\u2013]gray_-_wolf 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) They are even going to approach google and ask them to introduce new API's that allow us to determine if browser really chrome or just chromium, so that we block chromium.  I don't think this is possible in a way that would prevent firefox from just implementing the same api...  [\u2013]svandragt 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) Our manager said that we should optimize by the order of average revenue per user. The browser with highest revenue per user should be optimized the most.  That's not the same thing. The top 1% revenue visitor could be using be using a low revenue browser on aggregate. Or that one CEO the company needs to impress. So your manager is optimising for the wrong metric.  [\u2013]mistermithras 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) The ad-based revenue concept is no longer viable. If you need to monetize your site(s), do it with a subscription model. I, personally, will block ads on every browser and device I use or come into contact with. Needless to say, I'll never buy anything advertised to me in a browser.

[\u2013]dmarti 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) Your boss, like other web publishers, has two problems: ad blocking and data leakage. The first one is already covered in other posts on this thread. The second is a lot more complicated, but bigger in impact. (lower revenue share for publishers, less revenue for the medium as a whole, $19B in adfraud, and so on) I have written some material about both problems for DCN, which is a major publisher organization. If you want some ideas that you can share with your boss, you might be able to be more credible by sharing info from there, since your company might be a member: https:\/\/digitalcontentnext.org\/blog\/author\/dmartizgp-org\/ My contact info is on there if you have questions. (Disclaimer: Mozilla employee, also do web advertising reform stuff in my spare time)  [\u2013]GuruZZ 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago\u00a0(1 child) Most tech savvy people use Firefox and I doubt if they'll want to move away from it. We had to support it because in our case we had a lot of user base. I wouldn't make the call to drop Firefox support.  Regarding supporting ads, have you looked into Brave browser? It offers payment methods other than advertising. Maybe you can consider something like that?    [\u2013]nyxinfront-end 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) The only arguement that will appeal to your boss is this: Which is a greater loss to the company; the low percentage (by your own analytics\/admission) of FF users that are a net loss to the business by using up bandwidth and not being served ads, or the wasted money (developers salaries), time (spend doing more useful things), or energy \"fixing\" this? My guess is that you're time\/salary is worth more to the company that the minimal amount of bandwidth being used by an insignificant (to you) group that uses FF. You can chase the dragon all you want though...  [\u2013]jjdelc 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) Looks like he's attacking the wrong side of the correlation, because Firefox users are more likely to use ad blockers, doesn't mean he doesn't want Firefox, he really doesn't want users with ad blockers. Firefox is not the only browser that can block ads. Also, making the experience detrimental on Firefox is not going to increase revenue altogether, but say if 80% of Firefox users were blocking ads, then this means that you'll lose the revenue for those 20% as well. Actually decreasing income. I don't know how complicated your publisher design is, but it shouldn't be intricate enough that you're seeing big rendering differences between browsers anymore, and actually trying to support only one may be more effort than fixing small differences of today. Working on Chrome only, by the same cut will hurt IE and Edge users, you still want revenue from them. Best to use standards and don't focus on any browser, it is less expensive, doing the opposite makes you even less money.  As others said, the problem is in the ads strategy.

[\u2013]doomvox 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago\u00a0(0 children) This company-- like a lot of companies on the web-- needs a new business model.   Even if I weren't using an ad-blocker, you still won't be making any money off of me-- seeing an ad for something is more likely to make me avoid buying it.  I'm telling you something about what kind of person I am by running that ad-blocker-- why bother sending me something that won't do anyone any good?  If the idea here is you're going to tell your advertisers that my eyeballs are just as valuable as some pinhead that doesn't know how to install an ad blocker, then you're lying to them, and eventually they're going to catch on to that con.  I could be wrong, but I suspect that the economic argument for blocking traffic to someone with an ad-blocker is spurious, you're going out of the way to offend a segment of the audience in a fit of pique.  (It's pretty easy to keep me off of your site, just shove a popup in my face saying \"we notice you are using an ad blocker\".  Or for that matter, hit me with a popup that says anything at all, and I'm likely to zap the tab and move on.)

Advertising will just become more and more obnoxious to make up for the lost users, years after years (we're already far on that trend) and the share of people blocking it will just increase to the absolute top in consequence, it's a losing game which auto-feeds itself. Your employer is not optimizing for Chrome, it's trying to grasp the last parts of a dying industry. Instead of trying to do that, they should plan ahead and plan what they should do when the ad revenues drops to pocket change (Chrome or not), otherwise they in danger of getting bankrupt as well.

His passing leaves biohacking at a crossroads. Aaron Traywick lived life as a spectacle with all cameras rolling, so for those who knew him, it wasn\u2019t surprising that his death was shrouded in spectacle and controversy, too. At just 28, Traywick was among the most infamous figures in the world of biohacking\u2014the grandiose CEO of a tiny company called Ascendance Biomedical whose goal was to develop and test new gene therapies without the expense and rigor of clinical trials or the oversight of the FDA. Traywick wanted to cure cancer, herpes, HIV, and even aging, and he wanted to do it without having to deal with the rules and safety precautions of regulators and industry standards. \u201cThere are breakthroughs in the world that we can actually bring to market in a way that wouldn\u2019t require us to butt up against the FDA\u2019s walls, but instead walk around them,\u201d Traywick told me the first time I met him in person, during a biotech conference in San Francisco last January. To \u201cwalk around\u201d regulators, Ascendance and other biohackers typically rely on testing products on themselves. Self-experimentation, although strongly discouraged by agencies like the FDA, makes it difficult for regulators to intervene. The rules that govern drug development simply aren\u2019t written to oversee what an individual might do to themselves. At another conference in February 2018, Traywick dropped trou on stage and injected into his bare left thigh an experimental herpes treatment developed by his company. With that motion, he thrust the clandestine world of biohackers into the spotlight, defining for the world an image of these DIY biologists as a group of madcap impresarios. Shortly after, his company imploded in a conflagration of Jerry Springer-esque drama, some of which was caught on camera by Vice. Most of his coterie of biohacker contractors either quit or were fired (depending on who you ask), leaving Traywick with therapies he\u2019d promised to develop but no one to do the work. Still, Traywick seemed undeterred, recently launching a presale campaign in which people paid $35 to join a waiting list for Ascendance\u2019s unregulated therapies, even as it seemed highly unlikely that they would ever come to market. Then on Sunday, this dream of low-cost, open-access gene therapy came crashing down, when at the end of a session in a sensory deprivation tank at a D.C. spa, Traywick was found dead. The immediate reaction was disbelief. By Monday morning, my Facebook inbox was flooded with messages from biohackers wondering if this was perhaps yet another one of Traywick\u2019s stunts. Rumors and conspiracy theories ran amok. His exact cause of death is still unknown; police say the autopsy results are not expected for several weeks. While Traywick\u2019s life tested the limits of DIY science, his death symbolizes a crossroads for the movement. Will it continue to push the limits of self-experimentation or will it take steps to ensure safety? A Biohacker Regrets Publicly Injecting Himself With CRISPR  \u201cBefore Aaron, no one cared about what biohackers did,\u201d said Josiah Zayner, Traywick\u2019s rival of sorts and a biohacker who pioneered the on-stage injection stunt, in August of last year when he injected himself with a gene to promote muscle growth. \u201cThen we all realized maybe we should care more.\u201d A year ago, Traywick bulldozed into the biohacker scene seemingly from nowhere. When I first encountered him, it was not through biohacking but while reporting on a company call Inovium he had started with a pair of doctors in Greece. The company claimed it had developed a novel fertility treatment using something called platelet-rich plasma to help women who had difficulty conceiving. At the time, the company was launching a clinical trial for the treatment at several fertility clinics in the United States, claiming that in addition to helping premenopausal women conceive, the treatment could also potentially reverse menopause altogether. By a few months later, Ascendance had partnered with many of the most well-known figures in the biohacking sphere, offering funding, lab equipment, and the promise of profit-sharing to those willing to give their time and skills to Ascendance, developing extremely experimental therapies. Traywick\u2019s offer was attractive. Before Ascendance, most of them were self-funded, hackers tinkering in sheds and garages with lab equipment cobbled together from eBay. And the biohacking world offered Ascendance cheap labor that gave credence to its messaging of \u201cdecentralization\u201d and openness. \u201cWhen I first met him, I thought his company was much bigger than it was,\u201d David Ishee, a biohacker who worked with Traywick, told me. \u201cI thought they were really on to something.\u201d The reality was that Ascendance was mostly just Traywick. No one knew where his money came from, though it quickly gained him cachet in his new world. (Even his mother told me she was unclear where her son\u2019s funding came from. Other biohackers often speculated to me that Traywick was crypto-rich. Another family member suggested to me after his death that his grandparents had helped out.) Traywick was theatrical, a seemingly self-styled caricature, appearing frequently with unwashed hair and the same slightly oversized navy suit with a silk flower on the lapel. He was prone to exaggeration and misinformation, injecting nonsensical words like \u201cnanorobotic delivery\u201d into explanations of his company\u2019s science. The week before his on-stage demonstration, he began running Facebook ads claiming the company had developed both a \u201cvaccine\u201d and a \u201ccure\u201d for herpes, though there was no proof that it was either. He committed to impossible deadlines for completing therapies, which drove his biohacker contractors crazy. This is how he wound up testing a not-quite-completed herpes \u201ccure\u201d on himself on stage, when the original plan had been to test a \u201cvaccine\u201d on someone else. The vaccine wasn\u2019t ready, but Traywick had already committed to a live-demonstration as the final event of the conference. So Traywick announced to the world that he had herpes and took the stage himself. By the end of his life, Traywick had become estranged from the biohacking world. For his co-conspirators, the infamous on-stage herpes injection was the last straw. Even for those seeking to push the limits of biology outside the realms of academia and industry, Traywick\u2019s tactics seemed irresponsible and dangerous. Most of his collaborators told me the last time they had spoken to him was the night he locked himself in the company\u2019s Florida lab space, putting his contractors\u2019 equipment out on the sidewalk. (I covered this event for Gizmodo, which prompted a lawsuit from Traywick against Gizmodo that was ultimately dismissed. Zayner was also named in the same suit for comments he made on the matter in The Atlantic.) Traywick\u2019s death was covered in media outlets from Buzzfeed to The New York Post. In the aftermath of his death, many painted him as an eccentric visionary. \u201c...We consider it a deep shame that he will not have the opportunity to further develop his vision for open-access cures for diseases. The entire transhumanist and life-extensionist community is saddened and confounded by news of Aaron\u2019s death,\u201d the U.S. Transhumanist party wrote in an official statement on Traywick\u2019s death. But some in the biohacking community feel put-off by this celebratory tone. \u201cI believe in remembering people for who they were. And Traywick was the used-car salesman of the biohack world,\u201d said the Australian biohacker Meow-Ludo Disco Gamma Meow-Meow. Traywick, Meow-Meow said, was dangerous, but in his death many have softened their stance. \u201cI think a lot of people were like, \u2018Now he\u2019s dead let\u2019s just remember him for his mission rather than his actions.\u2019\u201d Before Traywick, most of the world left biohackers alone to tinker in their garages and basement. Few people even knew the community existed. But Traywick\u2019s actions\u2014grand public performances of DIY science to which he always invited the media\u2014drew attention from press, regulators, and all manner of critics. Shortly after he live streamed on Facebook a live trial of a gene therapy intended to cure HIV, the FDA issued a stern warning to biohackers in America. Undertaking DIY gene therapy, the agency said, is ill-advised and risky, and selling the supplies to do it is blatantly against the law. A few months later, Eleonore Pauwels, a bioethicist at the Wilson Center, wrote in Scientific American that such extreme DIY demonstrations moving out of the shadows was a dangerous trend. Traywick\u2019s death was big news, in part, because he made biohacking big news. \u201cHe got what he wanted,\u201d his mother, Rita Traywick, told me from her Alabama home the day before her son\u2019s funeral. \u201cThe notoriety. He made it.\u201d As much as others may want to discount Traywick as nothing more than a well-spoken showman, Zayner told me, he forced a reckoning in the biohacking world around what should be permissible. For Zayner, more than any other perhaps, that reckoning was extreme. Zayner himself was highly criticized for his own public DIY experiments, though somewhat less than Traywick was. Zayner was once a NASA scientist and holds a Ph.D., while Traywick came from a background in marketing, public relations, and community engagement. But Zayner says Traywick\u2019s antics are the reason he gave up such public demonstrations, and began to advocate for more safety and caution in DIY lab spaces. \u201cLooking at my actions in the past, which unfortunately did include a public injection in a semi-ridiculous manner, I want to apologize, in that I could have inspired people to think I was doing things on a whim when I was not,\u201d Zayner wrote in a mea culpa of sorts after Traywick\u2019s big stunt. Zayner told me that while Traywick looked up to scientists of the past who submitted themselves to experimentation, most of those scientists tested their experiments extensively before moving into people. And some of those scientists still died. Traywick, Zayner said, highlighted the weaknesses of the DIY bio community. \u201cWe need to figure out better ways to do this because you can\u2019t just keep injecting yourself with shit,\u201d he said. Currently, Zayner\u2019s company, The Odin, which sells DIY bio supplies, is working on creating DIY experiment kits made for use with frogs, so that people can practice science more safely, and not move straight to experimenting on themselves. The biggest shame, said Zayner, is that we\u2019ll never get the chance to see how Traywick might have matured once he\u2019d been in the biohacking sphere a little longer. Whatever their opinion of Traywick, everyone who knew him agreed that he was motivated by an extreme desire to make drugs more widely available for those who need them. \u201cEverything Aaron was doing, someone in our family had gone through that [illness],\u201d his niece, Kristin Bennett, told me. Bennett was just two years younger than Traywick, and she told me their relationship was more like siblings. \u201cAaron\u2019s always been an out of the box person. He always had his own way of doing things.\u201d For the biohacking community, the question now is how to move forward after the end of a life that demonstrated so clearly how easy it is for DIY experimentation to get out of hand. For the time being, not much has changed. The biohackers who worked with Traywick are still developing highly experimental products, including the one to cure HIV\u2014just not under the auspices of Ascendance. A new shadowy figure has even stepped in to fund such projects in Traywick\u2019s absence, a transhumanist offering some of Traywick\u2019s old collaborators money to fund his work. And one of Traywick\u2019s sometime partners in Europe is even attempting to take over the work of Ascendance and continue its mission. Ascendance was a \u201cdecentralized\u201d company, with no clear hierarchy other than Traywick at the top, so in the aftermath, no one is quite sure what will happen. What is clear, is that in death, Traywick\u2019s impact may loom even larger than it did in life. \u201c[Traywick] brought us a vision of what to avoid, I guess,\u201d Meow-Meow told me. \u201cHe will leave a legacy, I\u2019m just wondering what that will be, because it\u2019s looking to be a pretty powerful one, for better or worse.\u201d \n    An American Muslim travels to the West Bank to meet Israelis living in the occupied territory and the Palestinians who oppose them.\n Every year, more than 400,000 crabs are bled for the miraculous medical substance that flows through their bodies\u2014now pharmaceutical companies are finally committing to an alternative that doesn't harm animals. Horseshoe crabs are sometimes called \u201cliving fossils\u201d because they have been around in some form for more than 450 million years. In this time, the Earth has gone through multiple major ice ages, a Great Dying, the formation and subsequent breaking up of Pangaea, and an asteroid impact that killed the dinosaurs and most of life on Earth yet again. In other words, horseshoe crabs have truly seen some shit. Yet, I would conjecture, some of their strangest experiences must have come in just the past few decades, as one of the soft-bodied mammals that came after dinosaurs began using their hands to scoop horseshoe crabs out of the ocean en masse. Contemporary humans do not deliberately kill the horseshoe crabs\u2014as did previous centuries of farmers catching them for fertilizer or fishermen using them as bait. Instead, they scrub the crabs clean of barnacles, fold their hinged carapaces, and stick stainless steel needles into a soft, weak spot, in order to draw blood. Horseshoe crab blood runs blue and opaque, like antifreeze mixed with milk. Kanye West wants freedom\u2014white freedom. I could only have seen it there, on the waxed hardwood floor of my elementary-school auditorium, because I was young then, barely 7 years old, and cable had not yet come to the city, and if it had, my father would not have believed in it. Yes, it had to have happened like this, like folk wisdom, because when I think of that era, I do not think of MTV, but of the futile attempt to stay awake and navigate the yawning whiteness of Friday Night Videos, and I remember that there were no VCRs among us then, and so it would have had to have been there that I saw it, in the auditorium that adjoined the cafeteria, where after the daily serving of tater tots and chocolate milk, a curtain divider was pulled back and all the kids stormed the stage. And I would have been there among them, awkwardly uprocking, or worming in place, or stiffly snaking, or back-spinning like a broken rotor, and I would have looked up and seen a kid, slightly older, facing me, smiling to himself, then moving across the floor by popping up alternating heels, gliding in reverse, walking on the moon. A recent spate of #MeToo stories serves as yet another reminder of the centrifugal forces of talented men. On Monday evening, The New Yorker published yet more proof that the #MeToo moment continues apace: a report containing the testimony of four women accusing the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, of a range of physical and emotional abuses. The story, under the powerhouse co-byline of Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow, was striking\u2014and nauseating\u2014for several reasons, among them allegations of hitting, of threatening, of racism. One of the other reasons, though, was this line: \u201cAfter the former girlfriend ended the relationship, she told several friends about the abuse. A number of them advised her to keep the story to herself, arguing that Schneiderman was too valuable a politician for the Democrats to lose.\u201d Marchers from last year\u2019s Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville who attacked a black counter-protester made a claim that has often worked for police officers: They acted in self-defense. The photographs of the beating show DeAndre Harris curled up in a ball on the floor of a parking lot trying to protect his face and body as the men around him, some armed with boards or pipes, strike him repeatedly. The men beating Harris were there to attend the white-nationalist rally in Charlottesville last August, where one counter-protester, Heather Heyer, was killed when a car drove into the crowd. Harris, who survived the beating with eight staples in his skull, might have been the second. To an uninformed observer, the picture may look like an image of mob violence. But to many of the men beating Harris and their attorneys, it shows something else: Men acting in self defense. \u201cTo be honest, I was terrified,\u201d Jacob Scott Goodwin, one of the men arrested for beating Harris told the jury during his trial. \u201cI\u2019d probably perish or be sent to the hospital and be terribly hurt.\u201d The new music video from Childish Gambino weaponizes the viewer\u2019s instinctive bodily empathy. \u201cThis Is America\u201d isn\u2019t the first time that Donald Glover, as his musical alter ego Childish Gambino, has harnessed dance in service of surrealism. But the art form has a conspicuous symbolic significance in the artist\u2019s latest single, which Glover debuted on Saturday Night Live: The song\u2019s emphasis on dance was apparent in his live performance on the show, in the cover art for the track, and in the remarkable music video itself, which has more than 36 million views on YouTube as of publication. In the video, a grinning, shirtless Glover dances through a giant warehouse, occasionally accompanied by black school children in uniform, as chaotic scenes of violence unfold behind him\u2014and are sometimes enacted by him. What happens when a Pakistani American writer goes deep into the West Bank? I was here to report on Jewish settlers, the 600,000 citizens of Israel living beyond its pre-1967 borders. My main concern was whether the normally guarded and cautious settler community would open up and talk to me: a brown-skinned, practicing Muslim from the United States. I. The Old City Should I lie to an Israeli soldier in order to be allowed to pray? This was a theological dilemma I never studied in Sunday school, one I never thought I would have to confront. Anxious and on edge, the soldier was standing in front of me, rifle in hand, blocking my way, and all I had to do was tell him I was 50 years old, and then I could pray at one of Islam\u2019s holiest sites. One minor problem: I\u2019m 37. The question is less whether a dress or an idea is borrowed, than the uses to which it\u2019s then put. Meet the Death Metal Cowboys of Botswana. In black leather decorated with metal studs, they play a pounding style of music that people who know more than me trace to the British band \u201cVenom\u201d and its 1981 album Welcome to Hell. Question: Is this cultural appropriation? Why or why not? The question is inspired by a spasm of social-media cruelty that caught wide attention last week. A young woman in Utah bought a Chinese-style dress to wear to her high school formal. She posted some photographs of herself on her personal Instagram page\u2014and suddenly found herself the target of virulent online abuse. For once, the story has a happy ending. Good sense and kindness prevailed, and instead of her prom being ruined, the young woman exited the dance buoyed by worldwide support and affirmation, most of all from within China. Some researchers believe that the microbiome may play a role in regulating how people think and feel. By now, the idea that gut bacteria affect a person\u2019s health is not revolutionary. Many people know that these microbes influence digestion, allergies, and metabolism. The trend has become almost commonplace: New books appear regularly detailing precisely which diet will lead to optimum bacterial health. But these microbes\u2019 reach may extend much further, into the human brains. A growing group of researchers around the world are investigating how the microbiome, as this bacterial ecosystem is known, regulates how people think and feel. Scientists have found evidence that this assemblage\u2014about a thousand different species of bacteria, trillions of cells that together weigh between one and three pounds\u2014could play a crucial role in autism, anxiety, depression, and other disorders. The talk-radio host\u2019s willingness to indulge the fantasy of a mob marching on D.C. to oust Robert Mueller can be called many things\u2014but not \u201cconservative.\u201d Talk radio\u2019s Rush Limbaugh delighted at the expansive twists and turns of the independent counsel investigation of Bill Clinton, cheering it all the way to impeachment, despite polls suggesting Americans wanted Congress to censure the president and move on. He met Barack Obama\u2019s election by declaring that he wanted him to fail, then allied with men who tried to discredit Obama by falsely stating he was born abroad. But now that the nation\u2019s leading birther, Donald Trump, is in the White House, Limbaugh purports to be outraged by what he calls efforts to undermine and unseat a duly elected president. In recent segments on his show, he has claimed that Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation is \u201cactually a cover-up for all of the things the Obama administration and the Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee engaged in to try to taint the election,\u201d and additionally, that \u201cif these people don\u2019t like the way you voted, they\u2019re gonna just throw it out. They\u2019re gonna do whatever they can to undermine it and sabotage it, \u2019cause they don\u2019t like the result.\u201d Seth Meyers on Saturday Night Live, Obama, Oprah 2020, and whether media elites try too hard to feel the pain of Trump voters In 2011, the comedian Seth Meyers, then the head writer for Saturday Night Live and host of the show\u2019s \u201cWeekend Update\u201d news roundup, mocked Donald Trump at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner. \u201cDonald Trump has been saying that he will run for president as a Republican,\u201d Meyers said, as Trump sat stone-faced in the audience, \u201cwhich is surprising, since I just assumed he was running as a joke.\u201d That same evening, President Barack Obama roasted Trump at length. The evening\u2019s jokes\u2014and the idea that they spurred Trump to run in 2016\u2014have become Washington lore. Meyers, who since 2014 has hosted Late Night on NBC, still refuses to pull any punches where Trump is concerned. In January, he hosted the Golden Globes and, in a clear callback to his 2011 mockery of Trump\u2019s presidential ambitions, winkingly berated Oprah Winfrey, telling her that she doesn\u2019t have what it takes to be president.

Americas+1 212 318 2000 EMEA+44 20 7330 7500 Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000 The primary purpose of Californians for Consumer Privacy, an advocacy group formed by San Francisco real estate developer Alastair Mactaggart, is to push for a\u00a0ballot initiative adding restrictions on companies that profit from the collection of personal data. Last week, it gave state officials a petition with over 600,000 signatures, which should be enough to get it in front of voters in November.\u00a0 Its website, CAPrivacy.org, is pretty much what you\u2019d expect. There are creepy fictional videos portraying people's \u00a0birth date, physical location, and potentially embarrassing info about their online purchases (hair loss prevention shampoo) and the apps they use (online poker).\u00a0\u00a0Below the videos, there\u2019s a motivating message: \u201cIt\u2019s your personal information. Take back control!\u201d \u00a0 There is one surprising aspect, though. Each time someone visits, software gleans what information it can about her, then sends that information to Facebook, including her IP address, what web pages she was on before and after visiting, and so on. At this point, both the visitor and the website have basically lost\u00a0control of what happens with that information.\u00a0 That means the group has something in common with a lot of other sites.\u00a0At least\u00a079 percent of websites globally have\u00a0one or more\u00a0trackers\u00a0that collect\u00a0data on their users\u2019 online behavior, according to a 2017 study by\u00a0Ghostery, a company that makes ad blockers and privacy software. Over 21 percent have more than 10 trackers. Google trackers run 60 percent of the time any web page loads;\u00a0Facebook\u2019s run\u00a027 percent of the time. Both companies have trackers running on CAPrivacy.org, because the group put them there.\u00a0It may be hard to find a clearer testament to how entrenched such tracking has become as the default setting of the entire internet.\u00a0 Californians for Consumer Privacy does disclose the existence of the trackers in its privacy policy, which Mactaggart says he wrote himself. \u201cThe irony of criticizing\u00a0Facebook and Google whilst using their services is not lost on us, but\u00a0this gets back to our rationale for the initiative: Californians should be able to use these services and be secure that their personal information is not being sold. Right now\u00a0this is not\u00a0possible,\u201d it reads.\u00a0Mactaggart argues that Google and Facebook are monopolies and there\u2019s no real choice for someone looking to run an effective\u00a0website or online advertising campaign.\u00a0\u201cWe end up with this Faustian bargain,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Websites can exist without partnering with Google and Facebook. But few do\u2014because their tools are really useful. It helps that they\u2019re free and easy to use. The Facebook tracker consists of just nine lines of Javascript code. By installing it, website operators can determine whether people who saw their Facebook ads visited their site, and can target people after they\u2019ve left. At the same time, they let Facebook collect information about their users. The company deploys this data to build the profiles it uses to help other advertisers target web users with specific profiles\u2014and further entrench itself at the center of the internet economy.\u00a0 Facebook\u2019s critics, Californians for Consumer Privacy included, like to rail about the sale of personal data. But, as Mark Zuckerberg repeatedly pointed out during Congressional hearings last month, Facebook\u2019s business isn\u2019t about selling personal data. An advertiser can\u2019t simply purchase a list of names and IP addresses. Think of it more as a barter system. Websites share data to gain the ability to target ads, or learn more about their own audiences.\u00a0Facebook\u00a0pixel,\u00a0a tool for advertisers and developers,\u00a0collects information like a user\u2019s\u00a0IP address, available demographic information, and location data. Then the company sells ads that can be targeted using that data.  The inability of websites to resist the temptation of these tools is vital to Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s domination of the internet\u2014and a big part of how they\u2019ve gathered so much information about practically every person\u00a0online. \u201cEveryone is using Google Analytics, and everyone is\u00a0using the Facebook pixel,\u201d said Praneet Sharma, the chief executive of Method Media Intelligence, an ad tech consultancy. Both Facebook and Google oppose Mactaggart\u2019s ballot\u00a0measure, although Facebook recently withdrew from a\u00a0coalition actively\u00a0pushing for its defeat. Facebook has also been trying to reassure people that it will offer them more control over their data. It\u00a0says it\u2019s building a tool\u00a0that\u00a0would allow users to view which\u00a0websites send data, then clear that history. But any big changes to the default setting of the\u00a0internet as Facebook and Google have built it up aren\u2019t\u00a0going to be easy to come by.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just web architecture,\u201d said Sharma. \u201cPrivacy was an afterthought.\u201d\u00a0 This article also ran in Bloomberg Technology\u2019s Fully Charged newsletter.

Having acquired read-it-later service Pocket last year, Mozilla has been populating new tabs in Firefox with Pocket reading suggestions \u2014 and those are now going to include links that an advertiser has paid for. If you\u2019re using Firefox\u2019s nightly and beta builds, you might have already seen sponsored links appearing among the Pocket suggestions, and the feature will be making its way into the proper Firefox browser with the release of version 60 this month, as noted by The Register. In a blog post last week, Pocket founder Nate Weiner explained that the online \u201cadvertising model is broken,\u201d citing the loss of privacy, transparency, and control for the user. What he and Mozilla propose as an alternative is to restore all three of those facets to Firefox users while still generating some income by placing paid-for links in front of those users. Mozilla\u2019s promise is to only promote \u201cvaluable content, worthy of your time,\u201d while giving you the option to hide stuff you don\u2019t like or to disable sponsored suggestions altogether. Without the fine-grained targeting that Facebook and Google are able to offer advertisers, Mozilla will surely be making a lot less through its ads, but it seems like the company thinks it will be enough to make the irritation for its users worthwhile. With this new change in approach from Mozilla, the top alternatives to Google\u2019s Chrome browser are either limited in availability \u2014 Safari, which doesn\u2019t run on Windows or Android \u2014 or ad-supported, as in the case of Firefox and Opera. So you\u2019re either sacrificing privacy, device compatibility, or your own attention, depending on which trade-off you choose to make. It may be an annoyance to be confronted with such a choice, but it just goes to show that nothing useful on the internet is ever free.
